# SecureByDesignHandbook.com

This repository contains the source for SecureByDesignHandbook.com, an authoritative, vendor-neutral reference for building secure connected devices. It translates complex regulatory requirements (like the EU's Cyber-Resilience Act) into concrete engineering practices for product security teams.

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.
