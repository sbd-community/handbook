# SecureByDesignHandbook.com – Content & Brand Style Guide

## 1. Purpose

Define a consistent voice, visual language, and editorial standard so every article, guide, and UI element reinforces our mission: turning regulatory security requirements into actionable engineering practices for connected‑device makers.

## 2. Core Audience

| Role | Needs |
|------|-------|
| Product & Platform Owners | Plain‑English interpretation of CRA/NIS 2 and evidence artefacts. |
| Embedded/Firmware Engineers | Clause‑by‑clause implementation steps, code samples, reference configs. |
| Compliance Leads & Auditors | Gap‑analysis checklists, maturity models, audit‑ready templates. |
| Security & DevOps Teams | CI/CD hardening guides, SBOM/VEX pipelines, incident‑response runbooks. |

## 3. Voice & Tone

| Attribute | Guideline | Do | Avoid |
|-----------|-----------|----|----|
| Authoritative | Cite standards precisely; include clause numbers. | "CRA Art. 10‑3 requires…" | Vague claims ("industry best practice says…"). |
| Practical | End with next steps, scripts, or templates. | Provide Makefile snippets, checklist PDFs. | Pure theory without artefacts. |
| Vendor‑neutral | Mention multiple toolchains; disclose affiliations. | "You can use SWUpdate or Mender for OTA…" | Hard sells, single‑vendor bias. |
| Inclusive & Clear | Use plain language, define acronyms on first use. | Spell out "Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)". | Jargon without explanation. |

### Grammar & Mechanics

- Oxford comma required.
- Use active voice ("Validate keys" not "Keys are validated").
- Prefer second‑person orientation in tutorials ("You will…").
- Spell‑out numbers one → nine; 10+ in numerals.
- ISO 8601 dates (2025‑06‑11).

## 4. Terminology

- **Secure‑by‑Design (SbD)**: always capitalize S, D; hyphenate.
- **Product with Digital Elements (PDE)**: The formal, legal term from the Cyber-Resilience Act. Use this for precision when discussing the CRA's scope. Abbreviate as PDE after the first full mention.
- **Connected Device**: The preferred, general-purpose term for this handbook. It is a plain-English umbrella term covering PDEs, IoT devices, and other network-connected hardware.
- **IoT (Internet of Things)**: Use when discussing consumer-focused products or when referencing specific standards or guidance that use the term (e.g., ETSI EN 303 645, ICO's IoT guidance). Define on first use.
- **Cyber‑Resilience Act**: abbreviate as CRA after first mention.
- **NIS 2 Directive**: no hyphen (EU style).
- **SBOM, VEX**: define on first appearance.

Provide a glossary page and link from first usage.

## 5. Structure & Layout

### Headings

| Level | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| # (H1) | Title – one per page (auto‑generated by CMS). |
| ## (H2) | Major sections (e.g., "Implementation Steps"). |
| ### (H3) | Sub‑sections (e.g., "Generate Keys"). |
| #### (H4) | Optional deep sub‑sections; avoid > H4. |

### Paragraphs & Lists

- Keep paragraphs ≤ 120 words.
- Break complex sequences into ordered lists.
- Use tables for clause mappings; keep ≤ 4 columns for mobile readability.

### Call‑outs

- **Note**: supplementary info.
- **Warning**: risk or non‑compliance pitfall.
- **Tip**: productivity or tooling shortcut.

## 6. Code & Configuration Samples

| Standard | Rule |
|----------|------|
| Fenced blocks | Use triple‑backticks with language tag ( \`\`\`bash). |
| Width | ≤ 80 characters per line; wrap with \ where needed. |
| Comments | Precede with # (shell), // (C), explain why—not just what. |
| Sensitive data | Never show real credentials; use `<PLACEHOLDER>`. |

Include full example artefacts in repo `/examples/` and link inline.

## 7. Citation & References

- **Standards**: include document number, part, and clause (e.g., EN 303 645 §5.2).
- **Legal citations**: For EU regulations, use the format `[ACRONYM Art. X § Y(z)][link_id]`. Always include the regulation's acronym (e.g., `CRA`), a period after "Art", and the section symbol (§) for paragraphs. Example: `[CRA Art. 71 § 3][cra_art71]`. For Annexes, use the format `[Annex III.I.5][link_id]`, using Roman numerals for the annex number.
- **External links**: Use Markdown footnotes `[^1]` or inline links `[text](url)`. Open external sites in a new tab.
- For long reference tables, link to downloadable CSV/Excel.

## 8. Visual Identity & Branding

All visual elements of the brand—including the logo, color palette, typography, and iconography—are defined in the official **[Brand Guidelines](brand-guidelines.md)**.

That document is the single source of truth for the brand's visual identity. This style guide concerns itself with how to apply that identity to the content and structure of this website.

## 9. Accessibility

- All images require descriptive alt text.
- Don't convey meaning by colour alone; pair with icons or text.
- Ensure keyboard navigability & visible focus states.
- Test with screen‑reader (NVDA) before publishing.

## 10. SEO & Metadata

- Title tags ≤ 60 chars; include "Secure‑by‑Design" + topic keyword.
- Meta description ≤ 155 chars; mention "connected devices" or "products with digital elements".
- Use OpenGraph images (1200×630) with simple title overlay.

## 11. Review & Publishing Workflow

- [ ] Draft in Markdown → Pull Request.
- [ ] Peer Review by technical editor (check accuracy, voice).
- [ ] Compliance Review (clause correctness).
- [ ] Merge & Deploy (GitHub Actions).
- [ ] Post‑Publish QA: link checker, Lighthouse a11y audit.

## 12. Living Document
