# Build Phase Implementation Guides

Secure-by-design practices for the development and build phase of connected devices.

## Essential Build Phase Security

During the build phase, you establish the foundation of your device's security posture. These guides cover the core security implementations that must be built into your device before it ships.

## Available Guides

### [Secure Boot](/docs/implementation/build-phase/secure-boot)
Establish hardware root of trust and verified boot chains to ensure only authorized firmware runs on your devices.

### [Key Management](/docs/implementation/build-phase/key-provisioning)
Implement secure key generation, provisioning, and storage using hardware security modules and secure elements.

### [SBOM & VEX](/docs/implementation/build-phase/sbom-vex)
Generate and manage Software Bills of Materials and Vulnerability Exchange documents for supply chain transparency.

### [OTA Updates](/docs/implementation/build-phase/ota-updates)
Design secure over-the-air update mechanisms with cryptographic verification and rollback protection.
