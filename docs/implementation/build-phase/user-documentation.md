# Guide: Creating Compliant User Documentation

## 1. The 'Why': Documentation as a Legal Requirement

Clear, comprehensive user documentation is no longer just a "nice-to-have" for a good user experience; it is a mandatory legal requirement. The **[Cyber-Resilience Act (CRA)](./../../standards/eu/cra-overview.md)** provides a detailed list of information that manufacturers **must** provide to users to ensure they can install, use, and maintain the product securely.

This documentation is a key part of the evidence that will be reviewed by market surveillance authorities.

### 1.1. The Regulatory Requirement

The primary legal basis for user documentation is **Annex II of the CRA**, which outlines the "Information and instructions to be provided to the user." The BSI's technical guideline TR-03183-1 provides a corresponding set of requirements ([REQ_UD 1-6][bsi_tr_03183_p1]) that mirror the CRA's list.

Failing to provide this information means your product is not compliant.

### 1.2. What Constitutes User Documentation?

This refers to any information provided to the end-user, whether it's a printed quick-start guide, an in-app help section, or a full online user manual. The information must be clear, concise, and easy for a non-technical user to understand.

## 2. Information Required by CRA Annex II

Your user manual, whether printed or online, must include, at a minimum, the following information.

### 2.1 Product & Manufacturer Information
- **Manufacturer's Details:** Name, registered trade name, and a postal address where they can be contacted. ([REQ_UD 1][bsi_tr_03183_p1])
- **Product Identification:** The product's type, batch, or serial number so it can be uniquely identified. ([REQ_UD 2][bsi_tr_03183_p1])
- **Intended Use:** A clear description of the product's intended use, including the security environment provided by the manufacturer. ([REQ_UD 3][bsi_tr_03183_p1])

### 2.2 Security Properties & Configuration
- **Security Features:** Any security properties of the product (e.g., "This product uses end-to-end encryption").
- **Secure Configuration Guide:** Step-by-step instructions on how to securely install, configure, and operate the product. This should include guidance on changing default passwords. ([REQ_UD 5][bsi_tr_03183_p1])
- **Included Software:** Information on the software components included in the product, including the open-source components. This is most easily accomplished by providing a link to a web page containing the product's SBOM. ([REQ_UD 6][bsi_tr_03183_p1])

### 2.3 Support & Vulnerability Handling
- **Support Period End-Date:** The month and year until which the user can expect to receive security updates. This is a critical requirement. ([REQ_UD 4][bsi_tr_03183_p1])
- **How to Get Updates:** Instructions on how to receive and apply security updates, including whether the process is automatic or manual.
- **How to Report Vulnerabilities:** A link to the manufacturer's Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) policy and instructions on how users can report a potential security issue.

## 3. Compliance Checklist

To ensure your user documentation meets the CRA's requirements, use this checklist before releasing your product.

- [ ] **Manufacturer Identity:** Are your company's name and contact address clearly stated?
- [ ] **Product Identity:** Does the documentation specify how to identify the product's model and version?
- [ ] **Intended Use:** Have you clearly described the product's function and expected security environment?
- [ ] **Secure Setup Guide:** Are there clear, step-by-step instructions for secure installation and configuration?
- [ ] **Support Period Defined:** Is the end-of-support date (at least month and year) explicitly stated?
- [ ] **Vulnerability Reporting:** Is information provided on how to report a security vulnerability?
- [ ] **SBOM/OSS Information:** Is there information on the software components, or a link to where it can be found?
- [ ] **Accessibility:** Is the information provided in a clear and understandable way for a non-technical user?
