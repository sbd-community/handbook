# Guide: Key Provisioning & Storage

Securely managing cryptographic keys is the foundation upon which nearly every other device security guarantee is built. Without a trusted source of cryptographic material, features like secure boot, secure updates, and data protection are impossible to implement effectively.

Regulations like the **Cyber-Resilience Act (CRA)** mandate the protection of integrity and confidentiality ([CRA Annex I.I.2(f)][cra_annexI]), which implicitly requires that cryptographic keys are protected from disclosure and modification. This guide outlines the best practices for provisioning and storing keys in a way that establishes a robust, hardware-based root of trust.

## 1. The Key Management Lifecycle

Effective key management is a continuous process that covers the entire life of a key, from its birth to its eventual retirement.

1.  **Generation:** Keys must be created using a high-quality entropy source. A hardware-based True Random Number Generator (TRNG) is the gold standard. Generating keys off-device in a secure environment (like a Hardware Security Module - HSM) and then injecting them is often more secure and auditable than generating them on the device itself.

2.  **Provisioning:** This is the process of securely injecting keys and other secrets (like device identity certificates) into a device during manufacturing. This is a critical one-way step. Keys should be provisioned into a protected, write-once, or access-controlled hardware location. Insecure methods like including keys in a plaintext firmware image or flashing them over an unprotected interface must be avoided.

3.  **Storage:** Keys must be stored in a way that prevents their unauthorized extraction. The ideal storage location is within a hardware-backed secure vault, such as a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), a Secure Element (SE), or a protected region of memory managed by a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Storing keys in regular flash memory, even in an encrypted form, is less secure as it may be vulnerable to physical attacks.

4.  **Usage, Rotation & Revocation:** Cryptographic operations (e.g., signing, encrypting) should be performed *inside* the hardware security boundary. The key material itself should never be exposed to the main, non-secure processor. A mature security posture also includes plans for rotating keys over time and revoking them if they are compromised, often leveraging the device's secure update mechanism.

## 2. Hardware Roots of Trust

A "Root of Trust" (RoT) is a component that is inherently trusted within a system. For key management, this trust must be anchored in hardware. Here are common hardware technologies used to build a RoT:

| Technology | Description | Best for... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Secure Element (SE)** | A dedicated, tamper-resistant microcontroller designed to be a "key vault". It runs a hardened, specialized OS and exposes crypto services to the main processor via a limited interface (e.g., I2C). | Storing high-value keys that must resist physical extraction. Common in payment and SIM applications but widely available for IoT. |
| **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)** | A standardized component that provides secure key storage, cryptographic functions, and platform integrity measurement (attestation). It is governed by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) specification. | General-purpose secure storage, remote attestation, and disk encryption. A requirement for many enterprise and industrial systems. |
| **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)** | A secure area inside the main processor (e.g., ARM TrustZone, Intel SGX) that isolates security-critical code and data from the normal operating system. Keys are protected in memory, not necessarily a separate chip. | Protecting key *operations* when a separate hardware vault is not available. The keys are only as secure as the TEE's software implementation. |
| **Physically Unclonable Function (PUF)** | A circuit that leverages minute physical variations from the manufacturing process to produce a unique, device-specific "fingerprint". This can be used as a root key that is never explicitly stored in memory. | Creating a unique, unclonable device identity and a hardware-derived root key without needing to provision one. |

## 3. Compliance Checklist

To meet the requirements of modern cybersecurity standards, your key management strategy should address the following points:

- [ ] **Hardware-Backed Storage:** Have you selected a hardware RoT (SE, TPM, TEE, or PUF) to protect your most critical keys?
- [ ] **Secure Provisioning Process:** Is your manufacturing line equipped to inject keys securely, ideally using an HSM to communicate with the device's RoT?
- [ ] **No Default Keys:** Is every device provisioned with a unique set of keys? Are there no hardcoded, default, or predictable keys anywhere in your firmware?
- [ ] **Key Hierarchy:** Have you designed a key hierarchy? A hardware-protected root key should be used to protect other, less critical keys (e.g., application keys, communication keys) which can be updated or rotated if needed.
- [ ] **Limited Access:** Does your application code only access cryptographic *functions*? The raw key material should never be directly readable by the non-secure application processor.
- [ ] **Lifecycle Documentation:** Is your key management plan (generation, provisioning, rotation, revocation) documented in your technical file to demonstrate compliance to auditors and authorities?
