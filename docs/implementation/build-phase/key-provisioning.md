# Key Provisioning & Storage

**Status**: Coming soon

This guide covers secure key management practices for connected devices during the build phase.

## Key lifecycle management

- **Key generation** - Hardware vs software entropy sources
- **Key provisioning** - Secure injection during manufacturing
- **Key storage** - Hardware security modules, secure elements
- **Key rotation** - Lifecycle management and updates

## Implementation approaches

- **Hardware-based** - TPM, secure elements, HSMs
- **Software-based** - Key derivation, secure storage APIs
- **Hybrid approaches** - Combining hardware and software solutions
- **Platform-specific** - STM32, ESP32, ARM TrustZone implementations

## Security considerations

- Root of trust establishment
- Key hierarchy design
- Attestation mechanisms
- Side-channel attack protection
