# Implementation Guides

This section provides step-by-step technical guidance for implementing secure-by-design principles throughout the product lifecycle.

The guides are organized by the phase in which they are most relevant.

- **[Build Phase](./build-phase/index.md)**: Guidance on securing the device during manufacturing and development, including secure boot, key provisioning, and software bill of materials (SBOM) management.

- **[Operate Phase](./operate-phase/index.md)**: Guidance on maintaining security after the device has been deployed, including vulnerability disclosure, patch management, and hardening the CI/CD pipeline.
