# Tools: Security Logging & Monitoring

Effective **[Security Logging and Monitoring](../implementation/operate-phase/security-logging.md)** is critical for detecting security incidents, responding to them, and conducting post-mortem analysis. For connected devices, this often means collecting logs from the device itself and from the backend services it communicates with.

The tools in this category range from simple log aggregators to full-blown Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems that correlate data from multiple sources to identify potential threats.
