# Tools Overview

This section provides a curated list of tools to help you implement Secure-by-Design practices throughout the product lifecycle. The tools are categorized by their primary function.

A robust toolchain is essential for building and maintaining secure connected devices. The resources listed here cover key areas:

- **[Threat Modeling](./threat-modeling-tools.md)**: Tools for identifying and analyzing potential security threats early in the design phase.
- **[Static & Dynamic Analysis (SAST / DAST)](./static-and-dynamic-analysis.md)**: Tools for finding security flaws in your code, both before and after compilation.
- **[SBOM & Supply Chain Security](./sbom-and-supply-chain-security.md)**: Tools for generating, managing, and analyzing Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs).
- **[Firmware & Binary Analysis](./firmware-and-binary-analysis.md)**: Tools for inspecting compiled firmware when you don't have the source code.
- **[Hardware Root of Trust & Provisioning](./hardware-root-of-trust-and-provisioning.md)**: Technologies for creating and embedding a foundational device identity.
- **[Configuration & Hardening](./configuration-and-hardening.md)**: Tools for auditing and enforcing secure system configurations.
- **[PKI & Key Management](./pki-and-key-management.md):** Platforms for issuing and managing the digital certificates that underpin device identity.
- **[Device Lifecycle Management](./device-lifecycle-management.md)**: Platforms that automate device onboarding, monitoring, and end-of-life management.
- **[Secure Update & OTA Frameworks](./secure-update-and-ota-frameworks.md)**: Frameworks for building reliable and secure Over-the-Air (OTA) update capabilities.
- **[Vulnerability & Threat Intelligence](./vulnerability-and-threat-intelligence.md)**: Databases and feeds to stay on top of the latest security threats.
- **[Security Logging & Monitoring](./security-logging-and-monitoring.md)**: Platforms for collecting, analyzing, and responding to security events.
