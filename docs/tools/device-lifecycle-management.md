# Tools: Device Lifecycle Management

## 1. Introduction

Device Lifecycle Management (DLM) platforms provide the cloud-based infrastructure to manage a fleet of connected devices from initial activation through to end-of-life. They are a crucial component for meeting ongoing compliance and operational security requirements.

For a detailed overview of the different phases of a product's lifecycle, see our **[Implementation Guides](../implementation/index.md)**.

## 2. Tooling Landscape

These platforms typically offer a suite of services, including device monitoring, remote access, OTA updates, and security log collection. They are the operational backbone that enables a manufacturer to fulfill its post-market obligations under regulations like the CRA.

## 3. Build vs. Buy: A Clear Choice

Unless a company's core business is providing a global IoT cloud platform, the decision is straightforward: **buy a managed service**.

Building a secure, scalable, and reliable device management platform from the ground up is an immense undertaking. It requires dedicated teams of experts in cloud infrastructure, database management, security, and network operations. The cost and complexity are prohibitive for any company whose primary focus is manufacturing a physical product.

The practical and intelligent choice is to leverage one of the mature commercial platforms available. This allows you to focus your resources on your product's unique features and your customers' needs, while offloading the complex, undifferentiated work of cloud infrastructure to a trusted partner.
