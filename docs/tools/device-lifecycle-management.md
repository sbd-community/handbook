# Device Lifecycle Management Platforms

A device's security needs don't end after it's manufactured; they extend across its entire operational life. This category covers platforms that manage the device's security posture from its first connection to its last day in the field.

This involves two key phases:
1.  **Secure Onboarding (Bootstrapping):** Automating the complex workflow where a new device uses its factory identity to securely connect to a cloud service, prove its legitimacy, and get provisioned with its operational credentials.
2.  **Operational Management:** Continuously monitoring the device's integrity, managing its credentials (e.g., renewing certificates), and securely handling end-of-life events like revoking access for decommissioned or compromised devices.
