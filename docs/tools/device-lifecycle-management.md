# Tools: Device Lifecycle Management

## 1. Introduction

Device Lifecycle Management (DLM) platforms provide the cloud-based infrastructure to manage a fleet of connected devices from initial activation through to end-of-life. They are a crucial component for meeting ongoing compliance and operational security requirements.

For a detailed overview of the different phases of a product's lifecycle, see our **[Implementation Guides](../implementation/index.md)**.

## 2. Tooling Landscape

These platforms typically offer a suite of services, including device monitoring, remote access, OTA updates, and security log collection. They are the operational backbone that enables a manufacturer to fulfill its post-market obligations under regulations like the CRA.
