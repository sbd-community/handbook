# Secure Update & OTA Frameworks

A secure **Over-the-Air (OTA)** update mechanism is a critical piece of infrastructure for maintaining product security throughout its lifecycle. The **[Cyber-Resilience Act](../standards/cra-overview.md)** requires manufacturers to handle vulnerabilities "without delay" and provide security updates for a defined support period ([CRA Art. 13 § 8][cra_art13]). An OTA framework is the primary means of fulfilling this obligation.

These tools and frameworks provide the building blocks for creating a robust update system. They handle the complexities of delivering firmware to devices, ensuring updates are properly signed and verified, and managing the update process across a fleet of devices, including rollbacks in case of failure.
