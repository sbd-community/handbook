# Threat Modeling Tools

**[Threat Modeling](../implementation/build-phase/threat-modeling.md)** is a systematic process for identifying and mitigating security risks early in the development lifecycle. While it can be done with a simple whiteboard, dedicated tools can help structure the process, create professional data flow diagrams (DFDs), and maintain a living document of your product's security architecture.

These tools facilitate the key steps of threat modeling: defining what you're building, identifying what can go wrong (threats), and deciding what to do about it (mitigations).
