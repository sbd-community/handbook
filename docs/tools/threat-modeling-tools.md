# Tools: Threat Modeling

## 1. Introduction

Threat modeling is a structured process for identifying and prioritizing potential threats and vulnerabilities in a system. It is a proactive security practice that helps inform design decisions and security testing efforts.

For a detailed explanation of how threat modeling fits into a compliant development process and what is required, see our guide on **[Threat Modeling & Risk Analysis](../implementation/build-phase/threat-modeling.md)**.

## 2. Tooling Landscape

The following tools help teams create, manage, and collaborate on threat models. They provide graphical interfaces for building data flow diagrams (DFDs) and systematically identifying threats using methodologies like STRIDE.

| Tool | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool](https://aka.ms/threatmodelingtool) | 🐙 | A free, downloadable tool for finding threats in the design phase of software projects. It uses the STRIDE methodology and is ideal for Windows-based systems. |
| [OWASP Threat Dragon](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/) | 🐙 | An open-source, web-based threat modeling tool from OWASP. It provides a graphical interface for creating threat models and follows the STRIDE methodology. |
| [IriusRisk](https://www.iriusrisk.com/) | 🐙💰 | An open-source and commercial platform that automates the threat modeling process. It integrates with development tools to create a living threat model that evolves with the product. |
| [Threagile](https://threagile.io/) | 🐙 | An open-source, agile threat modeling toolkit that uses a YAML-based definition file to automatically generate threat models and diagrams. |
| [Tutum](https://www.tutum.tech) | 💰 | A commercial, collaborative threat modeling platform designed for enterprise teams. It focuses on usability and integration with the SDLC. |
