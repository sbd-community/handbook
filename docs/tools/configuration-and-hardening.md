# Configuration & Hardening Tools

Implementing a **[Secure Configuration](../implementation/build-phase/secure-configuration.md)** involves minimizing the attack surface of a device. While many hardening tasks are manual design decisions, several types of tools can help automate the process of verifying a system's configuration and security posture.

These tools can scan for open ports, check for misconfigurations, and help ensure that your production firmware doesn't contain unnecessary files or services.

| Tool | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--: | :---------- |
| [**Nmap**](https://nmap.org/) | 🐙 | The de facto industry standard for network mapping and port scanning. Essential for verifying which network services are exposed on your device. |
| [**OpenSCAP**](https://www.open-scap.org/) | 🐙 | An open-source ecosystem of tools for implementing and enforcing the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). It can be used to audit a system against a security baseline. |
| [**Lynis**](https://cisofy.com/lynis/) | 🐙 | A security auditing tool for Unix-based systems. It performs an extensive health scan to detect security issues and provide hardening suggestions. |
| [**Trivy**](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) | 🐙 | While primarily a vulnerability scanner, Trivy can also detect misconfigurations in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and other configuration files. |
| [**Tenable Nessus**](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) | 💰 | A widely used commercial vulnerability scanner that also provides detailed configuration and compliance auditing. |
