# SBOM & Supply Chain Security

A **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** is a formal, machine-readable inventory of all the software components, libraries, and dependencies included in a product. Maintaining an SBOM is a cornerstone of modern cybersecurity and a key requirement for the **[Cyber-Resilience Act](../standards/cra-overview.md)**, which mandates that manufacturers provide one as part of their technical documentation ([CRA Art. 13][cra_art13]).

These tools help automate the creation, management, and analysis of SBOMs. They enable manufacturers to quickly identify which products are affected by a newly discovered vulnerability in a third-party component, allowing them to meet the CRA's strict vulnerability handling timelines.
