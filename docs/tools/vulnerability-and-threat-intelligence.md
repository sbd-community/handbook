# Tools: Vulnerability & Threat Intelligence

## 1. Introduction

Effective vulnerability management requires manufacturers to continuously monitor the security landscape for new threats and vulnerabilities that may impact their products.

For a detailed explanation of the compliance requirements for vulnerability handling and disclosure, see our guide on **[Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)](../implementation/operate-phase/vulnerability-disclosure.md)**.

## 2. Intelligence Sources & Platforms

The resources listed here are the authoritative sources for this intelligence. They provide the databases, feeds, and platforms that manufacturers must monitor to track new CVEs in their dependencies, understand which vulnerabilities are being exploited in the wild, and meet their regulatory obligations.

| Resource | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [NVD (National Vulnerability Database)](https://nvd.nist.gov/) | 🐙 | The U.S. government's repository of standards-based vulnerability management data. This is the foundational source for most CVE information. |
| [CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) | 🐙 | A curated list of vulnerabilities that are known to be actively exploited in the wild. This is a critical resource for prioritizing patching. |
| [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories) | 🐙 | A database of security advisories related to open-source projects hosted on GitHub. |
| [Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV)](https://osv.dev/) | 🐙 | A distributed vulnerability database and automation infrastructure for open-source projects, maintained by Google. |
| [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) | 🐙 | A publicly available archive of exploits and vulnerable software, maintained by Offensive Security. |
| [FIRST.org EPSS](https://www.first.org/epss/) | 🐙 | Home of the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS), an open, data-driven effort for estimating the likelihood that a software vulnerability will be exploited. |
| [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/) | 💰 | A commercial threat intelligence platform that provides real-time data and analysis on vulnerabilities, threat actors, and attack trends. |
| [Mandiant Threat Intelligence](https://www.mandiant.com/threat-intelligence) | 💰 | Commercial intelligence services from Google Cloud, offering deep expertise on threat actors, malware, and attack campaigns. |
| [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/) | 💰 | A vulnerability coordination and bug bounty platform that connects businesses with penetration testers and cybersecurity researchers. |
| [Finite State](https://finitestate.io/) | 💰 | A product security platform that enriches its vulnerability findings by correlating data from over 200 threat intelligence sources. |
| [GreyNoise](https://www.greynoise.io/) | 💰 | A threat intelligence service that collects and analyzes internet-wide scan and attack traffic to help filter out internet "noise". |
