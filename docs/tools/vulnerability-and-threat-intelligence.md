# Vulnerability & Threat Intelligence

Effective vulnerability management requires continuous monitoring of the security landscape. The **[Cyber-Resilience Act](../standards/cra-overview.md)** obligates manufacturers to stay informed about vulnerabilities in their products and to take action, with special attention given to those that are actively exploited ([CRA Art. 14][cra_art14]).

The resources listed here are the authoritative sources for this intelligence. They provide the databases and feeds that manufacturers must monitor to track new CVEs in their dependencies, understand which vulnerabilities are being exploited in the wild (a key factor in prioritization), and meet their regulatory obligations to report and remediate issues in a timely manner.
