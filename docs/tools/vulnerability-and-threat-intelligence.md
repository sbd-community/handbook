# Vulnerability & Threat Intelligence

Effective vulnerability management requires continuous monitoring of the security landscape. The **[Cyber-Resilience Act](../standards/cra-overview.md)** obligates manufacturers to stay informed about vulnerabilities in their products and to take action, with special attention given to those that are actively exploited ([CRA Art. 14][cra_art14]).

The resources listed here are the authoritative sources for this intelligence. They provide the databases and feeds that manufacturers must monitor to track new CVEs in their dependencies, understand which vulnerabilities are being exploited in the wild (a key factor in prioritization), and meet their regulatory obligations to report and remediate issues in a timely manner.

| Resource | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--: | :---------- |
| [**NVD (National Vulnerability Database)**](https://nvd.nist.gov/) | 🐙 | The U.S. government's repository of standards-based vulnerability management data, represented using SCAP. This is the foundational source for most CVE information. |
| [**CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog**](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) | 🐙 | A curated list of vulnerabilities that are known to be actively exploited in the wild. This is a critical resource for prioritizing patching. |
| [**GitHub Advisory Database**](https://github.com/advisories) | 🐙 | A database of security advisories related to open-source projects hosted on GitHub. |
| [**Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV)**](https://osv.dev/) | 🐙 | A distributed vulnerability database and automation infrastructure for open-source projects, maintained by Google. |
| [**Exploit-DB**](https://www.exploit-db.com/) | 🐙 | A publicly available archive of exploits and vulnerable software, maintained by Offensive Security. |
| [**Recorded Future**](https://www.recordedfuture.com/) | 💰 | A commercial threat intelligence platform that provides real-time data and analysis on vulnerabilities, threat actors, and attack trends. |
| [**Mandiant Threat Intelligence**](https://www.mandiant.com/threat-intelligence) | 💰 | Commercial intelligence services from Google Cloud, offering deep expertise on threat actors, malware, and attack campaigns. |
