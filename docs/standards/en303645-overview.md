# ETSI EN 303 645 â€“ Consumer IoT Security

## 1. Why EN 303 645 matters now

**ETSI EN 303 645** is the globally-recognized baseline standard for the security of consumer-facing "Internet of Things" (IoT) devices. It establishes a practical, risk-based set of 13 high-level security and data protection provisions that manufacturers can implement to protect their products against common cybersecurity threats.

While it began as a European standard, its straightforward, non-prescriptive approach has led to its adoption or use as a foundation for IoT security regulations and certification schemes worldwide, including in the UK, Singapore, and Australia. For companies selling consumer IoT products globally, complying with EN 303 645 is the single most effective step towards meeting multiple international requirements.

**Relationship to EU law**

| Law | How it interacts with EN 303 645 |
|-----|---------------------------|
| **Radio Equipment Directive (RED)** | EN 303 645 is the primary **harmonised standard** for demonstrating compliance with the cybersecurity requirements of the RED Delegated Act (EU) 2022/30. Manufacturers who follow the provisions of this standard can claim a "presumption of conformity" with the RED's essential requirements for network protection, privacy, and fraud prevention when the deadline arrives on 1 August 2025. |
| **Cyber-Resilience Act (CRA)** | The CRA's essential security requirements in Annex I are heavily based on the principles in EN 303 645. It is expected that a future version of this standard (or a new standard based on it) will become a harmonised standard for the CRA. For manufacturers of "Default" category consumer products, compliance with EN 303 645 is an excellent way to prepare for future CRA obligations. |
