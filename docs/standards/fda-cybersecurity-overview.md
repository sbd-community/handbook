# FDA Cybersecurity Requirements for Medical Devices

## 1. Why FDA Cybersecurity Requirements Matter

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. With the increasing connectivity of these devices, cybersecurity has become a critical component of patient safety.

The **Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023** amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act by adding **Section 524B, "Ensuring Cybersecurity of Devices."** This section, often referred to as the "PATCH Act" provisions, creates a legal mandate for manufacturers of internet-connected medical devices (termed "cyber devices") to implement robust cybersecurity measures throughout the product lifecycle.

This means that for any new medical device submission, manufacturers must provide evidence to the FDA that their device is cyber-resilient by design.

- **FD&C Act Section 524B**: The full text of the law is embedded within the [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (see Sec. 3305)][patch_act].
- **FDA Cybersecurity Guidance**: The FDA maintains a central page for all its [cybersecurity guidance and resources][fda_cyber_guidance].
- **Recognized Standards**: The FDA recognizes certain standards that manufacturers can use. The key one for medical device cybersecurity is [UL 2900-2-1][ul_2900_std].

**Relationship to other regulations**

| Regulation | How it interacts with FDA Requirements |
|---|---|
| **[EU MDR / IVDR](./mdr-overview.md)** | The FDA's rules are the US counterpart to the cybersecurity requirements in the EU's Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR). While the legal structures differ, the core principles of secure-by-design, risk management, and lifecycle support are closely aligned. |
| **HIPAA** | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) focuses on protecting patient health information. FDA cybersecurity rules focus on the safety and effectiveness of the device itself. The two are complementary: a secure device is essential for protecting the data it processes. |

## 2. Key Requirements of Section 524B

Section 524B requires manufacturers to submit a comprehensive cybersecurity plan to the FDA as part of their premarket submission. This plan must demonstrate compliance with several key requirements.

### 2.1 Pre-Market Requirements

Before a device can be approved, the manufacturer must:

1.  **Submit a Cybersecurity Plan**: Provide a plan to monitor, identify, and address postmarket cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exploits in a reasonable time.
2.  **Design for Security**: Design, develop, and maintain processes and procedures to provide a reasonable assurance of the cybersecurity of the device and its related systems.
3.  **Provide a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**: Furnish an SBOM that includes all commercial, open-source, and off-the-shelf software components.

### 2.2 Post-Market Requirements

Once a device is on the market, the manufacturer has ongoing obligations to:

-   **Provide Updates and Patches**: Make available postmarket updates and patches to the device and related systems to address known vulnerabilities.
-   **Timely Remediation**: Ensure that patches are provided in a reasonable time and follow a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process.

## 3. The Role of Consensus Standards (UL 2900-2-1)

The FDA does not typically prescribe *how* manufacturers must meet its requirements. Instead, it recognizes "consensus standards" developed by Standards Development Organizations (SDOs). Following a recognized consensus standard is a streamlined way for manufacturers to demonstrate compliance.

For medical device cybersecurity, the key standard is **ANSI/UL 2900-2-1: Standard for Software Cybersecurity for Network-Connectable Products, Part 2-1: Particular Requirements for Network Connectable Components of Healthcare and Wellness Systems**.

By designing a product in accordance with UL 2900-2-1, manufacturers can provide strong evidence that their device meets the FDA's expectations for:

-   **Vulnerability & Weakness Management**: Identifying and mitigating known software weaknesses (e.g., from the OWASP Top 10).
-   **Risk Controls**: Implementing security controls like authentication, access control, and encryption.
-   **Secure Development**: Following a secure software development lifecycle (SDLC), including threat modeling and security testing.
-   **Documentation**: Providing the necessary documentation, including the SBOM, to demonstrate security.
