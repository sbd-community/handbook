# NIS 2 Directive (EU 2022/2555)

## 1. Why NIS 2 matters now

The **NIS 2 Directive (EU) 2022/2555** is a significant overhaul of the EU's cybersecurity rules, replacing the original 2016 NIS Directive. It aims to create a higher common level of cybersecurity across the Union by expanding the scope of sectors covered, introducing stricter security and reporting requirements, and strengthening supervisory and enforcement powers.

Unlike the Cyber-Resilience Act (CRA) which focuses on the security of *products*, NIS 2 focuses on the cyber resilience of *organisations* that are critical to the EU's economy and society. These organisations—now categorised as **'essential'** or **'important'** entities—must implement robust risk-management measures and report significant incidents to national authorities.

| NIS 2 milestone | Legal basis | Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Directive entered into force | [NIS2 Art. 42][nis2_art42] | **2023-01-16** |
| Member States must adopt national laws (transposition deadline) | [NIS2 Art. 41][nis2_art41] | **2024-10-17** |
| **NIS 2 rules become applicable in all Member States** | [NIS2 Art. 41][nis2_art41] | **2024-10-18** |

**Key Obligations from 18 October 2024**  
From this date, organisations within the scope of NIS 2 must:
*   Comply with the risk-management measures outlined in **[NIS2 Art. 21][nis2_art21]**, which include policies on supply chain security, incident handling, and the use of cryptography.
*   Adhere to the strict incident reporting timelines defined in **[NIS2 Art. 23][nis2_art23]**, including an initial warning to national authorities within **24 hours** of becoming aware of a significant incident.
*   Register with their national competent authority.

Management bodies of these entities can be held personally liable for non-compliance ([NIS2 Art. 32 § 6][nis2_art32]).

**Relationship to other EU laws**

| Law | How it interacts with NIS 2 |
|-----|---------------------------|
| **[Cyber-Resilience Act (CRA)](./cra-overview.md)** | NIS 2 governs *organisational* cyber risk; the CRA governs *product* security. A NIS 2 "essential entity" (like a hospital) must ensure its supply chain is secure ([NIS2 Art. 21][nis2_art21]), which means procuring products that are CRA-compliant. |
| **DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)** | DORA is a *lex specialis* (specific law) for the financial sector. Financial entities that fall under DORA are exempt from NIS 2's main provisions, as DORA's requirements are considered at least equivalent ([NIS2 Art. 4][nis2_art4]). |
| **CER Directive** | The Critical Entities Resilience Directive (EU 2022/2557) covers the *physical* resilience of critical infrastructure (e.g., against natural disasters or sabotage). NIS 2 covers their *cyber* resilience. The two directives are designed to work in parallel. |
