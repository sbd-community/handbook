ðŸš§ *This page is a stub.*

The Radio Equipment Directive 2014/53/EU sets essential requirements for radio devices sold in the EU. Articles 3(3)(dâ€“f) introduce cybersecurity clauses. Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/30 makes these clauses mandatory for most Bluetooth / Wi-Fi devices from **1 Aug 2025**.

A full quick-start guideâ€”including scope, timelines, and overlap with the CRAâ€”will appear here soon.
