# SecureByDesignHandbook.com – Purpose & Positioning Statement

## What we're building

SecureByDesignHandbook.com will be an authoritative, vendor-neutral reference and how-to manual for organisations that make, integrate, or operate products with digital elements—from IoT sensors and industrial controllers to connected consumer devices. The site will translate fast-moving regulatory obligations (EU Cyber-Resilience Act, NIS 2, ETSI EN 303 645, IEC 62443, etc.) into concrete engineering practices that teams can adopt without guesswork.

## Who it's for

| Stakeholder | Needs we address |
|-------------|------------------|
| Product & Platform Owners (OEMs, ODMs, brand labels) | Understand upcoming obligations, justify security investment, plan release roadmaps. |
| Embedded / Firmware Engineers & Architects | Clause-by-clause implementation guidance: secure boot flows, key storage, SBOM & VEX generation, OTA update hardening. |
| Compliance & Certification Leads | Gap-analysis checklists, evidence templates, audit-ready mappings between requirements and artefacts. |
| Security & DevOps Teams | Practical runbooks for CI/CD, vulnerability disclosure, SBOM lifecycle, and incident response integration. |

## What success looks like

1. **Clarity over complexity** – visitors leave with a plain-English grasp of how each regulatory clause translates into device design tasks.
2. **Immediate actionability** – every article ends with ready-to-use artefacts (checklists, reference configs, code samples, threat models).
3. **End-to-end perspective** – coverage spans silicon to cloud: hardware trust anchors, firmware update pipelines, backend services and operational monitoring.
4. **Community trust** – cited by regulators, standards bodies and industry groups as the go-to implementation companion for Secure-by-Design requirements.

## Content pillars

1. **Regulatory Explainers** – succinct breakdowns of CRA, NIS 2, EN 303 645, IEC 62443, FDA preemption, etc.
2. **Implementation Playbooks** – step-by-step guides (e.g., "Enabling Secure Boot on STM32," "Generating a VEX with OpenVEX").
3. **Lifecycle & Operations** – vulnerability disclosure policy templates, OTA rollback strategies, SBOM maintenance automation.
4. **Tools & Resources** – maturity-model worksheets, audit evidence packs, reference architectures, sample policies.

## Tone & voice

- **Authoritative** (standards-grade precision)
- **Practical** (engineer-friendly examples)
- **Vendor-neutral** (focus on principles, highlight multiple toolchains)

## Why it matters now

With the CRA's expected enforcement window (24 months after publication) and NIS 2 transposition deadlines approaching, manufacturers risk market withdrawal or fines unless they can prove security-by-design. SecureByDesignHandbook.com bridges the gap between legal text and firmware commit, helping teams move from "What does the law say?" to "What do we build next sprint?"
