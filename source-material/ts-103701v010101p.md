## Introduction

ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] specifies provisions for secure Internet of Things (IoT) products which are
widely considered as good practice in IoT security. There is a broad variety of consumer IoT products: some hold
sensitive personal data or fulfil safety-relevant functions, while others provide basic functionality such as play music or
monitor the weather. ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] is applicable to this entire spectrum and as such its
provisions are necessarily high-level and outcome-focused.
Multiple public and private sector organizations are operating and developing assurance schemes for consumer IoT
security. The present document is independent from an assurance scheme and seeks to contribute to a harmonised
approach to assessing the conformance of consumer IoT products against ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2].


## 1 Scope

The present document specifies a conformance assessment methodology for consumer IoT devices, their relation to
associated services and corresponding relevant processes against ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2],
addressing the mandatory and recommended provisions as well as conditions and complements of ETSI
TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] by defining test cases and assessment criteria for each provision.
The present document intends to support suppliers or implementers of consumer IoT products in first-party assessment
(self-assessment), user organizations in second party assessment, independent testing organizations in third party
assessment and certification and conformance declaration scheme owners in operating harmonized schemes. Defining a
certification or conformance declaration scheme is out of scope of the present document.
The present document intends to contribute to the protection of consumer IoT products against the most common
cybersecurity threats. Multi-medium or highly targeted/sophisticated attacks and thus the invasive analysis of hard- and
software modules is out of scope of the present document. The Test Scenarios (TSOs) are targeting basic effort
regarding test depth and test circumference in accordance to ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] which
addresses a baseline security level.
Due to the heterogeneity of consumer IoT devices, ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] and therefore the
associated test groups in the present document are formulated in a generic manner. Thus, the present document does not
describe specific tools or detailed step-by-step instructions. The test cases are intended to be performed by competent
bodies that have the expertise to derive a suitable test plan.

## 3 Definition of terms, symbols and abbreviations

## 3.1 Terms

For the purposes of the present document, the terms given in ETSI TS 103 645 [1], ETSI EN 303 645 [2] and the
following apply:
assess: generate a result by analysis using evaluator expertise
NOTE: The statement that uses this verb identifies what is analysed and the properties for which it is analysed.
The combination with the term "functionally" indicates, that the analysis needs to be performed
practically (e.g. using the DUT).
check: generate a result by a simple comparison
NOTE: Evaluator expertise is not required. The statement that uses this verb describes what is mapped. The
combination with the term "functionally" indicates, that the comparison needs to be performed practically
on the DUT.
Device Under Test (DUT): consumer IoT device (as defined in ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2]) that is the
target of the conformance assessment


Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS): statement, made by the SO, of the capabilities implemented in or
supported by the DUT
Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS) pro forma: document, in the form of a questionnaire, which when
completed for a DUT becomes the ICS
Implementation eXtra Information for Testing (IXIT): record which contains or references all of the information (in
addition to that given in the ICS) related to the DUT and its assessment environment, which will enable the TL to
perform appropriate test activities
Implementation eXtra Information for Testing (IXIT) pro forma: document, in the form of a questionnaire, which
when completed for a DUT becomes the IXIT

## 4 Conformance assessment methodology

## 4.1 Overview and document structure

Clause 4.2 describes the relevant roles and objects for the conformance assessment procedure.
Clause 4.3 describes the assessment procedure.
Clause 4.4 describes how to declare the conformity of the consumer IoT device to the provisions of ETSI
TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] in the Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS).
NOTE 1: ETSI TS 103 645 can be updated before ETSI EN 303 645. The scope of the present document lists the
compatible versions of ETSI TS 103 645/ETSI EN 303 645.
Clause 4.5 describes how to declare the corresponding security measures in the Implementation eXtra Information for
Testing (IXIT) using IXIT pro forma.
Clause 4.6 describes the details for how to assign verdicts for test cases, test groups and finally, how to assign an overall
verdict.
Clause 4.7 describes how to use external evidences instead of performing test groups to determine the conformance to a
provision.
Clause 4.8 highlights different aspects that assessment schemes typically address in addition of the content provided in
the present document.
Clause 5 contains the TSOs, where each TSO addresses a set of provisions from ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI
EN 303 645 [2] and is composed of a set of test groups that describe the assessment for a single provision. Each test
group is composed of a description of its objective and a set of test cases, where each test case describes how to assess a
specific aspect of the corresponding provision. The number of the test case is appended to the test group number (e.g.
Test case 5.1-3-2 for the second test case in Test group 5.1-3). Typically, the test cases distinguish two aspects:

- Conceptual: Assessing conformity of the IXIT against the requirements of the provision (conformity of
    design); and
- Functional: Assessing conformity of the DUT functionality, their relation to associated services or
    development/management processes against the requirements of the provision (conformity of implementation).
Each test case is composed of a description of its purpose, a set of indivisible test units and criteria for generating a test
case verdict. The TSOs and test groups mirror the structure and naming of the provisions.
Figure 1 illustrates the relation between ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] and the present document with
respect to a conformance assessment process. ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] contain provisions concerning
cyber security for consumer IoT.
NOTE 2: Terms, examples, notes, definitions and explanations from ETSI TS 103 645/ETSI EN 303 645 are also
valid and therefore not redundantly specified in the present document.
The present document is the basis for conformance assessment against ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] and
defines the ICS and IXIT pro forma. ICS and IXIT are provided by the SO based on the ICS and IXIT pro forma to the
TL. The TL uses these documents to derive a test plan.

## 4.2 Roles and objects

## 4.2.1 Device Under Test (DUT)

The Device Under Test (DUT) is a specific consumer IoT device (as defined in ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI
EN 303 645 [2]), which is subject to assessment against the provisions of ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2].
TSOs address the DUT functionality, its relation to associated services and development/management processes. For
the assessment the most up-to-date software version of the DUT should be used. The TL is able to control the DUT via
its offered interfaces and has partially knowledge about its design by the provided information in the IXIT (grey-box
testing). It is assumed that the DUT is in live operation and the TL is not in control of the associated services which
belong to the DUT.
NOTE: The methodology of the present document does not distinguish between different development stages
within the life cycle. However, for an effective assessment and to support secure product development
considering a separation between design and implementation phase is useful. Ultimately, a mature
implementation allowing live operation is necessary to finalize the assessment in particular regarding the
assessment of the relation to associated services and the publication of (user) information.
As illustrated in Figure 2, the present document intends to provide TSOs for a wide variety of consumer IoT devices
with different interfaces. Thus, the formulation of TSOs provides a certain level of abstraction as it is not feasible to
describe a specific testing procedure for every kind of consumer IoT device.

## 4.2.2 Supplier Organization (SO)

The Supplier Organization (SO) requests a specific DUT to be tested against the provisions of ETSI
TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2]. The SO can be the developer, manufacturer, vendor or distributor of the DUT.
The SO usually serves as single point of contact to the TL, and is expected to coordinate with parties across the
product's supply chain and ecosystem, such as component manufacturers, service providers and application developers.
The SO is supposed to have all necessary knowledge about the security measures of the DUT in order to provide the
ICS and IXIT. The SO is the applicant for the assessment and is expected to support the TL by providing all necessary
information for the assessment.


```
NOTE: The assessment process is designed for a cooperation between the TL and the SO. Accordingly, the SO
provides reliable ICS and IXIT for the assessment. Otherwise, an assessment using parts of the present
document is generally possible, but limits the validity of assessment results.
```
## 4.2.3 Test Laboratory (TL)

The Test Laboratory (TL) is (a defined part of) an entity that carries out the conformance assessment of a DUT. The
relation to associated services and development/management processes of the DUT are partially also considered in the
assessment (see ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2]).

NOTE: The competence of the TL has a strong influence on the validity of the assessment results. Requirements
on the competence of the TL, as e.g. specified in EN ISO/IEC 17025 [i.1], are out of the scope of the
present document.

Figure 4: Phases of the assessment procedure (informative example)
```
The present clause provides an abstract procedure for performing the conformance assessment against the provisions of
ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2]. The assessment procedure is performed by applying the following phases,
which are illustrated in Figure 4.
Phase 1: Completing the Identification of the DUT
The SO shall complete the Identification of the DUT. The pro forma to be filled and submitted by the SO is found in
clause A.2 of the present document.
Phase 2: Completing the ICS
The SO shall complete the ICS (see clause 4.4) in a correct manner. The pro forma to be filled and submitted by the SO
(referred to as user of the present document) is found in clause A.3 of the present document.
NOTE 1: Correct manner means for example claiming conditional provision as "N/A" in accordance with the
implemented functionality of the DUT. However, this does not oblige claiming recommended provisions
as "Yes" if a corresponding functionality exists.
Phase 3: Completing the IXIT
The SO shall complete the necessary IXIT information (see clause 4.5) for all provisions claimed as "Yes" in the ICS.
The pro forma to be filled and submitted by the SO is found in clause A.4 of the present document. Table B.1 gives an
overview which IXIT information is necessary for each provision.
The verification of the completeness, consistency and soundness of the IXIT shall be done by the TL in coordination
with the SO (contact person according to the Identification of the DUT). Annex C provides a sample IXIT to
demonstrate the scope and the level of detail on completing the IXIT.


Phase 4: Verifying the ICS
The TL shall validate the ICS by:
a) verifying, that no mandatory provision (according to the status column in clause A.3) is claimed as "No"; and
b) verifying, that if a "N/A" is claimed on the base of condition 4 or 5 (according to clause A.3), the Identification
of the DUT provides a valid "Justification" for the declaration of "Constrained Device" with respect to the
definitions in ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2]; and
c) verifying, that for all conditional provisions (according to the status column in clause A.3) claimed as "N/A"
there are no indications that the condition is contrary to the ICS fulfilled by the DUT; and
NOTE 2: The consideration of the user documentation, IXIT and the Identification of the DUT are helpful for the
plausibility verification of the "N/A" claims.
NOTE 3: The TL is not able to consider the assessment experience and results for the verification before
performing the assessment (Phase 5). Therefore, the result of the plausibility verification can be revised if
there are corresponding indications during the assessment. The final confirmation of the ICS verification
is proceeded when assigning the overall verdict at the end of the assessment (Phase 6) including the
assessment experience.
EXAMPLE 1: Provision 5.3-3 is marked as conditional regarding "an update mechanism is implemented"
(condition 12) in clause A.3 and claimed as "N/A" in the ICS. If any update mechanism is
implemented, the claim "N/A" is not correct.
d) verifying, that for all conditional provisions (according to the status column in clause A.3) claimed as "Yes"
there are no indications that the condition is contrary to the ICS not fulfilled by the DUT, except for condition
4 and 5 (according to clause A.3); and
NOTE 4: The conditions 4 and 5 address the performance of the DUT (constrained device) and are not a technical
prerequisite for applying the test cases. Therefore, these represent an exception and are not required to be
verified herein.
EXAMPLE 2: Provision 5.1-1 is marked as conditional regarding "passwords are used" (condition 1) in
clause A.3 and claimed as "Yes" in the ICS. If there are no passwords used by the DUT, the claim
"Yes" is not correct.
e) verifying, that there are no non-conditional provisions (according to the status column in clause A.3) claimed
as "N/A".
NOTE 5: The verification whether justifications for all not claimed recommended provisions exist is part of Phase 5
(see Test group 4-1).
Phase 5: Performing the assessment
The TL shall perform for each provision claimed as "Yes" in the ICS the corresponding test groups by devising a test
plan for the DUT under consideration of the IXIT information. The deviation of the test plan may include restructuring
and merging testing activities e.g. for optimization purposes where the same testing activity address multiple provisions.
NOTE 6: Some test cases require the verification of public documents (e.g. vulnerability disclosure policy) and the
publication itself. The concept of the test plan provides flexibility e.g. concerning the assessment in
development phase. Therefore pre-release documentations can be assessed in this phase such that only a
final verification of the corresponding publication in live operation is necessary.
The TL shall choose a specific test method including test equipment, test conditions and test instructions for performing
each test group. When assessment of the DUT functionality is required to perform a test group, the TL shall use tools
that are appropriate for the test execution under consideration of the IXIT information. No specific test tools and test
steps are prescribed by the test groups.
Each TSO defines test groups, test cases and test units. The TL should perform all test units on its own. However, the
present document does not preclude any alternative entity to perform the defined test units.
Some test groups refer to examples of best practices. The references provided are neither exclusive nor exhaustive.


The TL shall assign a verdict for each test case and test group as described in clause 4.6. For the assignment of verdicts
based on indications the TL shall document the used indications to achieve a reproducible result.
Phase 6: Assigning an overall verdict
The TL shall assign an overall verdict according to Table 1 in clause 4.6.
NOTE 7: According to Table 1 a verdict PASS means that all selected test groups on the base of the claimed
provisions in a valid ICS, at least all mandatory provisions (see clause 4.5), are fulfilled. When the
assessment ends with the assigned verdict FAIL, at least one claimed provision is not fulfilled or the
verification of the ICS according to Phase 4 was not successful.
NOTE 8: The aim of ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] is to apply as many provisions as possible to
realize a secure DUT. If the assignment of an overall verdict pass is prevented due to a test group verdict
FAIL or INCONCLUSIVE of a recommended provision, all assessment results can be reused for assigning an
overall verdict PASS for an ICS that does not claim conformance to these recommended provision when a
corresponding justification is provided.
NOTE 9: The details concerning the publication of the assessment results (e.g. definition of the specific content of
an assessment report) are out of scope of the current document and usually determined in an assessment
scheme. However, the publication of the ICS together with the overall verdict provides transparency,
especially concerning the implementation of recommended provisions and therefore incentives for the SO
to claim these provisions.

## 4.4 Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS)

The Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS) is made by the SO, of the capabilities implemented in or supported
by the DUT on the base of the provisions from ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2]. In the ICS the SO shall
claim all provisions which are planned for the assessment. This is done by a written "Yes" in the "Support" column.
NOTE 1: The ICS pro forma required for an assessment based on the present document is located in clause A.3. It
is expected that a future version of the present document uses an ICS pro forma from ETSI
TS 103 645/ETSI EN 303 645.
The mandatory provisions shall be claimed by the SO to achieve an overall PASS verdict. If a conditional provision
(mandatory or recommendation) cannot be fulfilled by the DUT a "N/A" (not applicable) shall be written in the
"Support" column. For every "N/A" a justification shall be given in the "Detail" column by the SO. For all provisions
not fulfilled but applicable by the DUT a "No" shall be written in the "Support" column. In this case also a justification
shall be given in the "Detail" column.
NOTE 2: In terms of a conditional provision a constrained device (defined in ETSI TS 103 645/ETSI EN 303 645)
represents a special case. It is possible to claim conformance against a conditional provision even it is not
necessary for a constrained device to fulfil the provision.
NOTE 3: Further guidance to fill in the ICS is given in clause A.3.

## 4.5 Implementation eXtra Information for Testing (IXIT)

The Implementation eXtra Information for Testing (IXIT) contains additional necessary information to perform the
assessment. It is the basis for grey-box testing methodology which is used for the assessment and provides some design
details for the TL.
The IXIT pro forma is provided in clause A.4. This pro forma describes necessary information on the implementation of
security measures addressing the corresponding provisions. In conjunction with the ICS (see clause 4.4) this
information is necessary for preparing and performing assessment activities.
Typically, test groups in the whole document can refer to entries in the IXIT pro forma. The order of the IXIT tables
and lists is oriented on the first use in the document. The SO is not required to complete all IXIT entries. Only entries
necessary for the provisions claimed as "Yes" have to be completed by the SO. Therefore Table B.1 provides a mapping
between provisions/test groups and IXIT entries.


The SO shall provide exhaustive and correct information on completing the IXIT. Annex C provides a sample IXIT the
SO can orient on concerning scope and the level of detail of the necessary information. An INCONCLUSIVE verdict (see
clause 4.6) may be assigned, if incomplete or insufficient IXIT information do not allow a proper test execution.
Alternatively to filling the IXIT the SO may add references to existing documentation there. In this case the referenced
documentation shall be provided by the SO to the TL. The identifiers inside the IXIT shall be used to enable a distinct
reference to any entry in a table, e.g. sequential numbering.

## 4.6 Assignment of verdicts

In general there are three kinds of verdicts: an overall verdict, test group verdicts and test case verdicts. The overall
verdict is i.a. composed of the results of the applied test groups (the test group verdicts). The test group verdicts are in
turn i.a. composed of the results of the contained test cases (the test case verdicts). For the test case verdicts there are
i.a. dedicated criteria in each test case for PASS and FAIL in the present clause.
The TL assigns the overall verdict according to the instructions of Table 1.

```
Table 1: Instructions for the assignment of the overall verdict
Overall verdict Instruction
PASS This verdict is assigned when no criterion for an overall verdict FAIL is fulfilled and:
```
- the ICS is valid according to Phase 4 in clause 4.3; and
- for each provision claimed as "Yes" in the ICS the corresponding test group is assigned a PASS verdict.
FAIL This verdict is assigned when:
- the ICS is not valid according to Phase 4 in clause 4.3; or
- for at least one provision claimed as "Yes" in the ICS the corresponding test group is assigned a FAIL verdict.
INCONCLUSIVE This verdict is assigned when no criterion for an overall verdict FAIL is fulfilled and:
- for at least one provision claimed as "Yes" in the ICS the corresponding test group is assigned an INCONCLUSIVE verdict.

The test group verdicts are achieved by applying the test groups claimed as "Yes" in the ICS. The test group verdict is
assigned according to the instructions of Table 2.

```

FAIL •^ an external evidence is provided which fulfils the requirements described in clause 4.7.
This verdict is assigned when: • at least one test case of the test group is assigned a FAIL verdict.
INCONCLUSIVE This verdict is assigned when no criterion for a test group verdict FAIL is fulfilled and:
- at least one test case of the test group is assigned an INCONCLUSIVE verdict.

The performance of each test case results in a test case verdict based on the criteria specified at the end of each test case
("Assignment of verdict"). The test case verdict is assigned according to the instructions of Table 3.

Test case verdict Instruction
PASS This verdict is assigned when:
```
- the required elements for the test case performance are present; and
- the criteria for PASS defined for each test case in the "Assignment of Verdict" are
FAIL fulfilled.
This verdict is assigned when: • the required elements for the test case performance are present; and
- the criteria for FAIL defined for each test case in the "Assignment of Verdict" are
fulfilled.


```
Test case verdict Instruction
INCONCLUSIVE This verdict is assigned when:
```
- the required elements (e.g. evaluation tools and IXIT information) for the test case performance are not present or are not sufficient to allow a proper execution of the test
    case and therefore no meaningful PASS or FAIL verdict can be assigned.

## 4.7 Usage of external evidences

Existing security certifications or third party evaluations of parts of the DUT may be used partially as evidence for the
conformance to reduce the effort of the assessment. In this case the SO shall announce in the "Detail" column of the
addressed provision in the ICS that conformance is already assessed combined with a reference to the according
evidence. Moreover the SO shall provide all necessary information (e.g. certification, certification details, test reports)
for the verification of the evidence to the TL. The TL shall verify in the assessment whether the evidence is adequate to
fulfil the corresponding test group. The following aspects shall be examined by the TL to assign a PASS verdict for the
corresponding test group without applying the test cases:

- the scope of the evidence shall be appropriate to the corresponding test group objective; and
- the description of the test activities being part of the evidence shall meet each test purpose inside the
    corresponding test group; and
- the test depth respectively the evaluation assurance level of the evidence shall be appropriate to the
    corresponding level addressed by the test group.

## 4.8 Assessment scheme amendments

An assessment scheme typically provides a frame for the performance of an assessment. ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI
EN 303 645 [2] and the present document can be used by an assessment scheme, such as a manufacturer scheme, a self
assessment scheme or a certification scheme. Figure 5 illustrates the role of an assessment scheme and the possible
integration of amendments regarding ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] and the present document.


```
Figure 5: Role of an assessment scheme
```
On the base of the generic provisions from to ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] it is not possible to derive
specific criteria for every kind of implementation for each test case. Therefore the experience of the TL is needed to
adapt the given criteria in the test cases if necessary. The requirements on the experience and equipment of the TL are
typically part of an assessment scheme.
The present document contains informative content concerning best practice security. In particular cryptographic
requirements are typically defined by the assessment scheme considering the corresponding information in the present
document and the properties of the technology, risk and usage. This allows comparability of the assessment results
under a specific scheme.
NOTE: In the cases of a certification scheme this type of specification is typically done by the party which is
responsible for the scheme. Otherwise in an internal assessment scheme this is normally done by a part of
the SO (e.g. testing division).
The assessment scheme typically specifies requirements for third party evidence (e.g. certificate from another
certification scheme) that is accepted within an assessment (see clause 4.7).

## 5.1.2.1 Test case 5.1-2-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the generation mechanisms of pre-installed passwords.
Test units
a) The TL shall assess for each authentication mechanism in IXIT 1-AuthMech using pre-installed passwords
according to "Authentication Factor", whether the generation mechanism in "Password Generation
Mechanism" induces obvious regularities in the resulting passwords.
NOTE 1: Incremental counters (such as "password1", "password2" and so on) can be obvious regularities.
b) The TL shall assess whether the generation mechanism induces common strings or other common patterns in
the resulting passwords.
NOTE 2: Common strings can be those contained in password dictionaries, such as for example:
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/static-assets/documents/PwnedPasswordsTop100k.txt.
c) The TL shall assess whether the generation mechanism induces passwords, that are related in an obvious way
to public information.

d) The TL shall assess whether the generation mechanism induces passwords, that are considered appropriate in
terms of complexity.


NOTE 4: In this context complexity is linked to the probability of guessing the password while applying the
information an attacker has. The length of a password is one important aspect to consider for a password's
complexity.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- no obvious regularities in pre-installed passwords are found; and
- no common strings or other common patterns in pre-installed passwords are found; and

## 5.1.3 Test group 5.1-3

## 5.1.3.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.1-3.
According to ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] best practice cryptography is defined as cryptography that is
suitable for the corresponding use case and has no indication of a feasible attack with current readily available
techniques.
The objective of this test group is to assess, firstly, whether the cryptographic methods provide the security guarantees
that are necessary for the authentication mechanisms and, secondly, whether the cryptographic methods are not known
to be vulnerable to a feasible attack.


## 5.1.3.1 Test case 5.1-3-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the cryptography used for the authentication mechanisms

shall assess whether the "Security Guarantees" are appropriate for the use case of user authentication, at least
integrity and authenticity are required to be fulfilled.
b) For each authentication mechanism in IXIT 1-AuthMech used to authenticate users against the DUT, the TL
shall assess whether the mechanism according to "Description" is appropriate to achieve the "Security
Guarantees".
NOTE 1: A holistic approach is required to assess the security of the mechanism.
c) For each authentication mechanism in IXIT 1-AuthMech used to authenticate users against the DUT, the TL
shall assess whether the "Cryptographic Details" are considered as best practice cryptography for the use case
of user authentication based on a reference catalogue. If "Cryptographic Details" are not included in a
reference catalogue for the corresponding use case (e.g. novel cryptography), the SO shall provide evidences,
e.g. a risk analysis, to justify the cryptography is appropriate as best practice for the use case. In such case the
TL shall assess whether the evidence is appropriate and reliable for the use case.
NOTE 2: A use case based list of examples for best practice cryptography is given in ETSI TR 103 621 [i.7].
Moreover general reference catalogues of best practice cryptography are available, for example:
 SOGIS Agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms (https://www.sogis.eu).
NOTE 3: A cryptographic algorithm or primitive that is deprecated with regard to its desired security property
(e.g. SHA1 for collision resistance) or that relies on a cryptographic parameter (e.g. key-size) that is not
appropriate, taking into account the intended lifetime of the DUT and cryptoagility, cannot be considered
as best practice cryptography.
d) For each authentication mechanism in IXIT 1-AuthMech used to authenticate users against the DUT, the TL
shall assess whether the "Cryptographic Details" are not known to be vulnerable to a feasible attack for the
desired security property on the base of the "Security Guarantees" by reference to competent cryptanalytic
reports.
NOTE 4: Competent cryptanalytic reports are typically published in the scientific literature or, alternatively, are to
be provided by the SO. Further, clause D.2 provides information about the expected attack potential for
level basic.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if for all user authentication mechanisms:

- the security guarantees are appropriate for the use case of user authentication; and
- the mechanism is appropriate to achieve the security guarantees with respect to the use case; and
- all used cryptographic details are considered as best practice for the use case; and
- all used cryptographic details are not known to be vulnerable to a feasible attack for the desired security
    property.

## 5.3 TSO 5.3: Keep software updated

## 5.3.1 Test group 5.3-1

## 5.3.1.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.3-1.
This test group handles the updatability of each software components except software updates are beyond practicability
or absent for a security reason. According to ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] "securely updateable" means
that there are adequate measures to prevent an attacker misusing the update mechanism.
NOTE: Any discovery of software components in the DUT is out of scope of this test group.


## 5.3.1.1 Test case 5.3-1-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the updatability of software components concerning the
absence of software updates a) and the update mechanisms b).
Test units
a) For each software component in IXIT 6-SoftComp with an empty list in "Update Mechanism", the TL shall
assess whether the implementation of software updates is beyond practicability or for a security reason as
described in the justification for the absence of software updates.
EXAMPLE 1: An IoT device can contain separate microcontrollers from the main system which are only
internally addressable. Those microcontrollers typically act as an internal service provider (e.g.
temperature controller of a smart wine rack) sometimes without update functionality. A software
update for those components can be beyond practicability for the DUT.
EXAMPLE 2: For some implementations, the security concept for the DUT can require that a component is not
changeable (e.g. software which is part of the trust chain of the bootloader). Therefore the
component is not updateable for superordinate security reasons.
b) The TL shall apply all test units as specified in the Test case 5.3-2-1 to every referenced "Update Mechanism"
in IXIT 6-SoftComp.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- for all software components without the ability for software updates, a software update is not possible for
    practicability reasons or security reasons; and
- no update mechanism can be misused by an attacker.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.3.1.2 Test case 5.3-1-2 (functional)................................................................................................................

a) The TL shall apply all test units as specified in the Test case 5.3-2-2 to every referenced "Update Mechanism"
in IXIT 6-SoftComp.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- there is no indication that a misuse of any update mechanism is possible.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.3.2 Test group 5.3-2

## 5.3.2.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.3-2.
This test group examines that at least one update mechanism for the secure installation of software updates exists.


## 5.3.2.1 Test case 5.3-2-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the update installation mechanism concerning adequate
measures to prevent an attacker misusing the update installation on the DUT.
Test units
a) For each update mechanism in IXIT 7-UpdMech, the TL shall assess whether the design of the update
mechanism prevents misuse from an attacker according to the "Security Guarantees", the corresponding
"Description", "Cryptographic Details" and "Initiation and Interaction".
NOTE: The consideration of the baseline attacker model described in clause D.2 is helpful for the examination.
EXAMPLE: A misuse can be the installation of an old software update to downgrade the security capabilities of
the DUT or the injection of malware by manipulating a valid update.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- one update mechanism of the DUT cannot be misused by an attacker.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.3.2.2 Test case 5.3-2-2 (functional)................................................................................................................

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the functional assessment of the effectiveness of the update mechanism to avoid misuse.
Test units
a) For each update mechanism in IXIT 7-UpdMech, the TL shall devise functional attacks to misuse the update
mechanism based on the "Description".
EXAMPLE 1: If applicable try a Man-In-The-Middle attack (MITM) between the DUT and the update server.
NOTE 1: An attack can be trying to resume the sequence of update steps after some failure of a specific update
step, installing an older firmware version that contains security vulnerabilities, or changing one byte in a
signed firmware to check that it is rejected.
NOTE 2: There are multiple ways to perform an indication based security analysis even if no update is available
during the assessment, e.g. verify a file based update mechanism on the base of old update packages.
b) The TL shall attempt to misuse each update mechanism on the base of the devised adverse actions and assess
whether the design of the mechanism (see "Description", the "Cryptographic Details" and "Initiation and
Interaction") effectively prevents the misuse of software updates as described in the "Security Guarantees".
EXAMPLE 2: If a file based update mechanism uses signature verifications, providing a manipulated update
package to the DUT can be helpful to collect indications.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- there is no indication that a misuse of one update mechanism of the DUT is possible.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.


## 5.3.3 Test group 5.3-3

## 5.3.3.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.3-3.
According to ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] in terms of this test group an update that is simple to apply
will be automatically applied, or initiated using an associated service (such as a mobile application) or via a web
interface on the device. However, this does not exclude alternative solutions.
The focus of the provision is on triggering the update from the user perspective and verifying whether the user is
provided with the ability to update all software components in a simple manner. This case is given if each software
component is updatable with at least one simple update mechanism.

## 5.3.3.1 Test case 5.3-3-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the update mechanisms concerning simplicity for the user
to apply an update.
Test units
a) For each software component in IXIT 6-SoftComp, the TL shall assess whether at least one "Update
Mechanism" is described, which is simple for the user to apply according to "Initiation and Interaction" in
IXIT 7-UpdMech based on the following factors:

- the software update is automatically applied without requiring any user interaction; or
- the software update is initiated via an associated service; or
- the software update is initiated via a web interface on the device; or
- the software update uses a comparable approach which is applicable for the user with limited technical
    knowledge (see clause D.3).
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:
- each software component is covered by at least one update mechanism, which is simple for the user to apply.

privileged user and is protected by the OS access control, attempting to gain access to the
parameter over unprivileged processes (e.g. path manipulation via remote interfaces) can be
helpful to collect indications.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- for every sensitive security parameter there is no indication that the implementation of the corresponding
    protection scheme differs from its IXIT documentation.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.4.2 Test group 5.4-2

## 5.4.2.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.4-2.
In this case hard-coded unique per device identity is an individual and static value, that represents the DUT and
potential hard-coded information the value is derived from.
The test group addresses the identification of hard-coded device identities and whether adequate protection needs are
identified. A functional evaluation for tamper proof storage by any means is not in focus of this TSO.
NOTE 1: The conceptual evaluation of protection schemes for tamper-resistance of hard-coded identities and an
inspection for indication for the correct implementation of the corresponding schemes is part of Test
group 5.4-1 by construction. However, the corresponding test units are referenced here and are
optimizable when deriving a test plan.
NOTE 2: A communicated device identity can be derived from a - potentially secret - piece of information that
persists in hardware (e.g. a seed value for a randomization algorithm). This information can be considered
as part of a device identity.

## 5.4.2.1 Test case 5.4-2-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of tamper-resistant storage of hard-coded identities.
Test units
a) The TL shall check whether for each sensitive security parameter in IXIT 10-SecParam where the
"Description" indicates that it is used as an hard-coded identity, a corresponding explicit statement is provided.


b) The TL shall assess whether for each hard-coded identity as indicated in "Description" in IXIT 10-SecParam
the corresponding "Security Guarantees" provide tamper-resistance.
NOTE 1: Tamper-resistance addresses protection against means such as physical, electrical and software means.
NOTE 2: Consider the usage of external evidences (see clause 4.7) to (partially) cover the provision if a secure
element is used.
c) The TL shall assess whether the "Protection Scheme" of each hard-coded identity as indicated in "Description"
in IXIT 10-SecParam provides the claimed "Security Guarantees" with respect to tamper-resistance.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- there is no indication that any hard-coded identity is not documented as such; and
- for all hard-coded identities the security guarantee includes tamper-resistance; and
- every hard-coded identity has a suitable protection mechanism for tamper-resistance.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.4.2.2 Test case 5.4-2-2 (functional)................................................................................................................

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the functional assessment of tamper-resistant storage of hard-coded identities.
Test units
a) The TL shall functionally assess whether each hard-coded identity as indicated in "Description" in
IXIT 10-SecParam the "Protection Scheme" with respect to tamper-resistance is implemented according to the
IXIT documentation.
NOTE: Typically, while examine the DUT for indicating evidences for the existence and enforcement of the
documented protection scheme for a sensitive security parameter, indication for non-conformity of the
implementation can be found, if existing on a basic level.
EXAMPLE: If the "Protection Scheme" states that a hard-coded identity is protected against tampering by a
secure element, verifying the existence and the correct integration of a secure element can be
helpful to collect an indication.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- for every hard-coded identity, there is no indication that the implementation of any protection scheme with
    respect to tamper-resistance differs from its IXIT documentation.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.4.3 Test group 5.4-3

## 5.4.3.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.4-3.
In this case a hard-coded parameter in device software source code is a static value, that is common in every device
where the same code as for the DUT is implemented.


This test group assesses whether there is an indication for not documented hard-coded critical security parameters in
device software source code in the provided provisioning mechanisms for critical security parameters. Wherever critical
security parameters are hard-coded in device software source code the assessment focuses on conformity of design and
functional evaluation of the provisioning mechanism that makes sure that these are not used during the operation of the
DUT. This approach cannot provide strong assurance for completeness of the IXIT documentation concerning the
identification of hard-coded critical security parameters in device software source code.
It is noted that this approach does not preclude supplementary approaches, e.g. active approaches based on scanning the
software of the DUT for embedded patterns that match critical security parameters. Supplementary approaches are at
the discretion of the TL.
NOTE: Public security parameters can be embedded in the object code of the software of the DUT.

## 5.4.3.1 Test case 5.4-3-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of hard-coded critical security parameters.
Test units
a) The TL shall check whether for all critical security parameters provided in IXIT 10-SecParam where
"Provisioning Mechanism" indicates that it is hard coded in device software source code, the fact is reflected
in "Description".
b) The TL shall assess whether for all critical security parameters in IXIT 10-SecParam, which are hard coded in
device software source code according to "Description", the corresponding "Provisioning Mechanism" ensures
that it is not used during the operation of the DUT.
NOTE: According to the definition of critical security parameter in ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2]
the disclosure or modification of such a parameter can compromise the security of the DUT. Parameters
where disclosure or modification compromises solely other assets (e.g. intellectual properties) are not
covered by the definition.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- there is no indication that any critical security parameter hard-coded in device software source code is not
    documented as such; and
- for all critical security parameter hard-coded in device software source code, the "Provisioning Mechanism"
    ensures that it is not used during the operation of the DUT.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.4.3.2 Test case 5.4-3-2 (functional)................................................................................................................

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the functional assessment of hard-coded critical security parameters.
Test units
a) The TL shall functionally assess whether for all critical security parameters hard-coded in device software
source code documented in "Description" of IXIT 10-SecParam, the "Provisioning Mechanism" is indeed
applied during the operation of the DUT.
EXAMPLE: If a provisioning mechanism states that a hard-coded critical security parameter is intended to be
replaced by the user using individual data (e.g. based on a QR code), the verification that the user
is requested to input this data can be helpful to collect an indication.


Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- for all critical security parameter hard-coded in device software source code there is no indication that the
    application of the provisioning mechanism differs from its IXIT documentation.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.4.4 Test group 5.4-4

## 5.4.4.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.4-4.
This test group assesses by documentation whether all critical security parameter addressed by the underlying provision
are identified and that their generation mechanisms meet the corresponding requirement.

## 5.4.4.1 Test case 5.4-4-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of critical security parameters used for integrity and
authenticity checks of software updates and for protection of communication with associated services concerning the
generation mechanisms.
Test units
a) The TL shall check whether all critical security parameter provided in IXIT 10-SecParam, where
"Description" indicates that the critical security parameters are used for integrity and authenticity checks of
software updates or for protection of communication with associated services are documented as such in
"Generation Mechanism".
b) The TL shall assess for all critical security parameters provided in IXIT 10-SecParam, whether the
"Generation Mechanism" ensures that the critical security parameter is unique per device and produced with a
mechanism that reduces the risk of automated attacks against classes of devices.
NOTE 1: A random number generator used for the generation of the critical security parameter that has been
certified (e.g. against a scheme applicable under the European Cybersecurity Act) can be seen as a source
of sufficient entropy.
NOTE 2: It is also possible that custom solutions (that are e.g. not certified) provide sufficient entropy for the use
case of the DUT.
NOTE 3: The degree to which a generation mechanism is widely accepted as appropriate for a given use case is a
function of the consensus among the subject matter community. Generation mechanisms that are
standardized rank highest in such consensus, due to the high degree of scrutiny to which they are
subjected in their development. Standardization bodies offer publicly available sources of information on
suitable generation mechanisms, e.g. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) runs the
Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program [i.2] for random bit generators, key derivation, secure
hashing, etc. In regard to end-to-end security and communities to which SME IoT manufacturers are
possibly keener with, Mozilla® publicly lists configuration profiles for Transport Layer Security (TLS)
[i.3]. Finally, there are publicly available catalogues of references to relevant standards, e.g. the
KeyLength catalogue [i.4] that indexes standards published by NIST, ANSSI, BSI, etc. on the matter of
cryptographic key length.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- all critical security parameter where the purpose in "Description" indicates that the critical security parameters
    are used for integrity and authenticity checks of software updates or for protection of communication with
    associated services are documented as such in "Generation Mechanism"; and


- for all critical security parameters the "Generation Mechanism" ensures that the critical security parameters are
    unique per device and produced with a mechanism that reduces the risk of automated attacks against classes of
    devices.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.5 TSO 5.5: Communicate securely

## 5.5.1 Test group 5.5-1

## 5.5.1.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.5-1.
According to ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] best practice cryptography is defined as cryptography that is
suitable for the corresponding use case and has no indication of a feasible attack with current readily available
techniques.
The objective of this test group is to assess, firstly, whether the cryptographic methods provide the security guarantees
that are necessary for the use case of the communication and, secondly, whether the cryptographic methods are not
known to be vulnerable to a feasible attack.

## 5.5.1.1 Test case 5.5-1-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the cryptography used for the communication mechanisms
concerning the use of best practice cryptography (a-c) and the vulnerability to a feasible attack d).
Test units
a) For each communication mechanism in IXIT 11-ComMech, the TL shall assess whether the "Security
Guarantees" are appropriate for the use case of the communication.
b) For each communication mechanism in IXIT 11-ComMech, the TL shall assess whether the mechanism
according to "Description" is appropriate to achieve the "Security Guarantees".
NOTE 1: A holistic approach is required to assess the security of the communication mechanism.
c) For each communication mechanism in IXIT 11-ComMech, the TL shall assess whether the "Cryptographic
Details" are considered as best practice cryptography for the use case of secure communication based on a
reference catalogue. If "Cryptographic Details" are not included in a reference catalogue for the corresponding
use case (e.g. novel cryptography), the SO shall provide evidences, e.g. a risk analysis, to justify the
cryptography is appropriate as best practice for the use case. In such case the TL shall assess whether the
evidence is appropriate and reliable for the use case.
NOTE 2: A use case based list of examples for best practice cryptography is given in ETSI TR 103 621 [i.7].
Moreover general reference catalogues of best practice cryptography are available, for example:
 SOGIS Agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms (https://www.sogis.eu).
NOTE 3: A cryptographic algorithm or primitive that is deprecated with regard to its desired security property
(e.g. SHA1 for collision resistance) or that relies on a cryptographic parameter (e.g. key-size) that is not
appropriate, taking into account the intended lifetime of the DUT and cryptoagility, cannot be considered
as best practice cryptography.
d) For each communication mechanism in IXIT 11-ComMech, the TL shall assess whether the "Cryptographic
Details" are not known to be vulnerable to a feasible attack for the desired security property on the base of the
"Security Guarantees" by reference to competent cryptanalytic reports.


NOTE 4: Competent cryptanalytic reports are typically published in the scientific literature or, alternatively, are to
be provided by the SO. Further, clause D.2 provides information about the expected attack potential for
level basic.

- the security guarantees are appropriate for the use case of secure communication; and
- the mechanism is appropriate to achieve the security guarantees with respect to the use case; and
- all used cryptographic details are considered as best practice for the use case; and
- all used cryptographic details are not known to be vulnerable to a feasible attack for the desired security

## 5.5.2.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.5-2.
The terms "reviewed" and "evaluated" allow for a range of way to fulfil this provision. The term "reviewed" hints at
actions undertaken for finding and correcting defects, e.g. an independent security audit or a continuous process
allowing review and disclosure of vulnerabilities (a bug tracking system or automated code analysis). The term
"evaluated" hints at a formal comparison against a set of objectives, e.g. a recognized certification scheme.

    report; or
- the necessary information is not obtainable, because the DUT does not provide any information on the
    implementation name and version.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.5.3 Test group 5.5-3

## 5.5.3.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.5-3.
The ability to update cryptographic algorithms and primitive does not only rely on the existence of an update
mechanism. It requires that the implementation can be replaced on the device, and that software that rely on
cryptographic algorithms and primitives can support such replacement.
The objective of this test group is to assess, firstly, whether there is an update mechanism for each software component
indicating such implementation and, secondly, whether the implementations providing cryptographic algorithms and
primitives can be replaced and side effects of updating are considered by the manufacturer.

- for every software component indicating cryptographic usage an update mechanism is referenced; and
- side effects of updating those algorithms and primitives are considered by the manufacturer.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.5.4 Test group 5.5-4

## 5.5.4.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.5-4.
There exist many authentication methods based on a variety of authentication factors and applying to different subjects
(such as persons, devices, or functions). Three important characteristics to look for is whether the authentication method
can discriminate between multiple subjects, whether it can reject authentication attempts based on invalid credentials or
no proper access rights (effectiveness), and whether it is resistant to an adversary by providing its own security
guarantees or rely on the security guarantees provided by an underlying protocol (e.g. TLS).
The objective of this test group is to assess, firstly, whether the device functionalities are accessible only after
authentication, secondly, whether the authentication method can discriminate between different subjects, thirdly,
whether it is effective and resistant to adversaries and, finally, whether the authorization step is effective.

## 5.5.4.1 Test case 5.5-4-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of device functionality via a network interface in the
initialized state concerning authentication and authorization.
Test units
a) For each device functionality in IXIT 13-SoftServ indicated as accessible via network interface in the
initialized state according to "Description", the TL shall check whether there is at least one "Authentication
Mechanism" referenced.
b) For each "Authentication Mechanism" referenced in IXIT 13-SoftServ, the TL shall assess whether the
authentication mechanism described in IXIT 1-AuthMech allows to discriminate between multiple
authentication subjects and can reject authentication attempts based on invalid identities and/or authentication
factors.
NOTE: Discriminating is typically done based on unique identities and/or authentication factors.


c) For each "Authentication Mechanism" referenced in IXIT 13-SoftServ, the TL shall assess whether the means
protecting the authentication mechanism in "Cryptographic Details" in IXIT 1-AuthMech provide the
"Security Guarantees" identified for the mechanism and are resistant to attempts at compromising the
mechanism.
d) For each "Authentication Mechanism" referenced in IXIT 13-SoftServ, the TL shall assess whether the
authorization process described in "Description" in IXIT 1-AuthMech allows authenticated subjects with
proper access rights to be granted access and denies authenticated subjects with inadequate access rights or
unauthenticated subjects to be granted access.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- at least one authentication mechanism is referenced for every device functionality accessible via network
    interface in the initialized state; and
- every authentication mechanism allows to discriminate between multiple authentication subjects and to reject
    authentication attempts based on invalid identities and/or authentication factors; and
- the means used to protect an authentication mechanism provide the expected security guarantees and are
    resistant at attempts to compromise the mechanism; and
- every authorization mechanism allows access to authenticated subjects with proper access rights; and
- every authorization mechanism denies access to authenticated subjects with inadequate access rights and to
    unauthenticated subjects.

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the functional assessment of device functionality via a network interface in the
initialized state concerning authentication and authorization.
Test units
a) For each "Authentication Mechanism" referenced in IXIT 13-SoftServ, the TL shall functionally assess
whether an unauthenticated subject and a subject with invalid identity or credentials and an authenticated
subject without appropriate access rights cannot access the device functionality in the initialized state.
NOTE: This test unit cannot in principle distinguish between the authentication and the authorization step -
implementation aiming at reducing information leak will not disclose which step would fail to the subject.
b) For each "Authentication Mechanism" referenced in IXIT 13-SoftServ, the TL shall functionally assess
whether an authenticated subject with appropriate access rights can access the device functionality in the
initialized state.
c) For each "Authentication Mechanism" referenced in IXIT 13-SoftServ, the TL shall functionally assess
whether the protection of the authentication mechanism conforms to the description in "Security Guarantees"
and "Cryptographic Details" in IXIT 1-AuthMech.
EXAMPLE: If a PKI certificate based authentication is used, sniffing the used certificates and comparing the
properties with the described cryptography in the IXIT can be helpful to collect an indication.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if for every device functionality accessible via network interface in the initialized state:

- an unauthenticated subject, a subject with invalid identity or invalid credentials and an authenticated subject
    without appropriate access rights cannot access the functionality in the initialized state; and


- an authenticated subject with appropriate access rights can access the device functionality in the initialized
    state; and
- there is no indication that the mechanism to secure the authentication differs from its IXIT documentation.

## 5.6 TSO 5.6: Minimize exposed attack surfaces

## 5.6.1 Test group 5.6-1

## 5.6.1.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.6-1.
In principle a logical interface can be accessible via a plurality of network interface: the manufacturer therefore ensures
that all access paths to a logical interface are identified. The manufacturer disables those network and logical interfaces
that are not required to provide the device functionality, depending on the interface purpose. This requires having
knowledge of their platform and understand which components provide network or logical interfaces, and how. This is
critical when hardware platforms and components from third-parties are reused.

## 5.6.1.1 Test case 5.6-1-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the network and logical interfaces of the DUT.
Test units
a) For each network and logical interface in IXIT 15-Intf that is described as enabled according to "Status", the
TL shall assess whether the purpose of the interface in "Description" provides a valid justification for being
enabled.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- for every network or logical interface that is marked as enabled in the IXIT documentation, there is a purpose
    that provides a valid justification for the interface to be enabled.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.6.1.2 Test case 5.6-1-2 (functional)................................................................................................................

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the functional assessment of the network and logical interfaces of the DUT a) and the
completeness of the IXIT documentation b).
Test units
a) For each network and logical interface in IXIT 15-Intf, the TL shall functionally check whether the status of
the interface matches the "Status" in the IXIT documentation.


NOTE: A possible method to analyse an interface is to use protocol testing tools in a black-box setting and to
infer from the obtained information whether the interface is enabled or disabled on the DUT. For cases
where the DUT provides an indication (e.g. a visual indication of connectors, antennas and components)
whether the interface is enabled or disabled, the accessibility test allows to confirm or disprove the
indication.
b) The TL shall functionally assess whether network or logical interfaces that are not documented in IXIT 15-Intf
are available via a network interface on the DUT.
EXAMPLE: Network scanning tools allow for discovery of network or logical interfaces.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- every documented network or logical interface that is marked as disabled in the IXIT documentation is found
    to be disabled or not accessible on the DUT; and
- every discovered network and logical interface is documented in the IXIT.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.6.2 Test group 5.6-2

## 5.6.2.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.6-2.
The principle of minimization applied to security-relevant information in unauthenticated context dictates that only such
information that is necessary for device or service operations in unauthenticated context are disclosed. It is to be noted
that the manufacturer might not be able to minimize disclosed information if requirements exist to conform to
standardized protocols which, by design, disclose more information than necessary.
EXAMPLE: MAC address in Ethernet, Bluetooth® and Wi-Fi®, ARP, DNS.

## 5.6.2.1 Test case 5.6-2-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the information disclosed by network interfaces without
authentication in the initialized state.
Test units
a) For each network interface in IXIT 15-Intf, the TL shall assess whether the "Disclosed Information" disclosed
by the interface without authentication in the initialized state and indicated as not security-relevant, is however
security-relevant.
b) For each network interface in IXIT 15-Intf, the TL shall assess whether the "Disclosed Information" disclosed
by the interface without authentication in the initialized state and indicated as security-relevant, is necessary
for the operation of the DUT.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if for every network interface:

- every security-relevant information disclosed by the interface without authentication in the initialized state is
    documented as such; and
- all security-relevant information disclosed by the interface without authentication in the initialized state is
    necessary for the operation of the DUT.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.


## 5.6.2.2 Test case 5.6-2-2 (functional)................................................................................................................

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the functional assessment of the information disclosed by the network interfaces without
authentication in the initialized state.
Test units

- for every network interface, only security-relevant information can be observed that is described in the IXIT
    documentation.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.6.3 Test group 5.6-3

## 5.6.3.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.6-3.
Some physical interfaces require exposure in order to allow normal operations. The remaining interfaces are to be
protected in exposure. In order to identify the appropriate level of protection, the introduction of ETSI
TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] is considered, which indicates a protection "against elementary attacks on
fundamental design weaknesses". Taking this in consideration, protection from exposure for physical interfaces is
relative to the device casing, i.e. the protection is sufficient when accessing the physical interface requires opening or
breaking the device casing (this does not preclude stronger measures when necessary) or similar measures.
It is to be noted that protection through the casing is not effective for air interfaces. Such air interfaces that do not
require exposure are to be disabled. Interfaces that are not permanently necessary require a form of trusted enabling
mechanism (with a default of disabled).
The objective of this test group is to assess on the one hand, whether physical port interfaces that never require exposure
are protected by the device casing. On the other hand it is assessed, whether air interfaces that never require exposure
are disabled.

## 5.6.3.1 Test case 5.6-3-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the physical interfaces of the DUT concerning interfaces
that do not require exposure in general (a-b) and interfaces that do not require permanent exposure c).
Test units
a) For each physical interface in IXIT 15-Intf that does not require exposure according to "Description", the TL
shall assess whether the protection means of the interface in "Protection" include protection by the device
casing or similar measures.
NOTE: For air interfaces it is acceptable that the antenna part remains outside of the device casing.
b) For each air interface in IXIT 15-Intf that does not require exposure according to "Description", the TL shall
check whether the interface is disabled according to "Status".
c) For each physical interface in IXIT 15-Intf that does not require permanent exposure according to
"Description", the TL shall check whether the interface is disabled according to "Status" for all periods in
which the use of the interface is not required.


Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- for every physical interface that does not require exposure, the protection means of the interface includes
    protection by the device casing or similar measures; and
- for every air interface that does not require exposure, the interface is disabled; and
- for every physical interface that does not require permanent exposure, the interface is disabled for all periods
    in which the use of the interface is not required.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.6.3.2 Test case 5.6-3-2 (functional)................................................................................................................

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the completeness of the IXIT documentation a) and the functional assessment of the
physical interfaces of the DUT (b-d).
Test units
a) For each physical interface identified on the DUT the TL shall functionally check whether exposed physical
interfaces on the DUT are contained in IXIT 15-Intf and described as required or intermittently required in
"Description".
b) For each physical interface identified on the DUT that does not require exposure according to "Description"
the TL shall functionally assess whether physical interfaces on the DUT are protected by device casing or
similar measures.
NOTE: For air interfaces it is acceptable that the antenna part remains outside of the device casing.
c) For each air interface identified on the DUT the TL shall functionally check whether it is enabled or disabled
as indicated in "Status" in IXIT 15-Intf.
d) For each physical interface identified on the DUT the TL shall functionally assess whether the physical
interfaces that are not permanently required are disabled for all periods in which the use of the interface is not
required.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- all exposed physical interfaces on the DUT are described as "required" or "intermittently required" in the IXIT
    documentation; and
- all physical interfaces that are identified as never requiring exposure in the IXIT documentation, the interface
    is protected by the device casing or similar measures; and
- all air interfaces that are enabled on the DUT are marked as "required" or "intermittently required" in the IXIT
    documentation; and
- for all physical interfaces that are marked as "intermittently required" in the IXIT documentation, the interface
    is disabled for all periods in which the use of the interface is not required.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.6.4 Test group 5.6-4

## 5.6.4.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.6-4.


Similar considerations to those of Test group 5.6-3 apply, with the exception that a software mechanism to disable the
debug interface is mandatory. Here, the debug interface might be permanently disabled in software or, if it is foreseen
that it can be useful in specific cases of the device lifecycle, be under the control of a trusted software mechanism.
Considering the level of security intended by ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2], physically accessible is
defined as being readily usable with a standard interface cable. Using specific tooling to physically access the interface
(such as testing probes) is not in scope of the assessment.

## 5.6.4.1 Test case 5.6-4-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of physically accessible debug interfaces of the DUT.
Test units

software mechanism to disable the interface.
b) For each physical interface in IXIT 15-Intf that is described as an accessible debug interface, that is not
indicated as intermittently required according to "Description", the TL shall check whether the interface is
disabled permanently according to "Status".
c) For each physical interface in IXIT 15-Intf that is described as an accessible debug interface, that is indicated
as intermittently required according to "Description", the TL shall check whether the interface is disabled by
default according to "Status".
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- for every accessible physical debug interface, there is a software mechanism described to disable the interface;
    and
- for every accessible physical debug interface that is not indicated as intermittently required, the interface is
    permanently disabled; and
- for every accessible physical debug interface that is indicated as intermittently required, the interface is
    disabled by default.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.6.4.2 Test case 5.6-4-2 (functional)................................................................................................................

tools.


Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- every accessible physical debug interface is disabled; and
- every physical debug interface is indicated as such in the IXIT.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.6.5 Test group 5.6-5

## 5.6.5.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.6-5.
There exist primarily three approaches to fulfil this provision, firstly, a service management framework is configured to
only launch and manage those software services that are required for the operation of the consumer IoT device.
Secondly, access to these software services is prevented through a filtering mechanism such as a packet filter (firewall),
even if such service is active. Finally, software services that are not required for the operation of the device are not
installed - this is the hardest approach and it goes beyond the requirements of the provision.
It is to be noted that it is difficult to achieve full minimization, for example there can be services that are enabled by
default by an IoT platform provider.

## 5.6.5.1 Test case 5.6-5-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the enabled services concerning the intended use or
operation of the DUT.
Test units
a) For each software service in IXIT 13-SoftServ that is enabled by default according to "Status", the TL shall
assess whether the service is necessary for the intended use or operation of the DUT according to the purpose
in "Description" and the "Justification" for enabling the service.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- for every enabled by default software service, the service is necessary for the intended use or operation of the
    DUT.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.6.6 Test group 5.6-6

## 5.6.6.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.6-6.
There exist many options to minimize code. Within large software projects, automated tools can be used to identify and
remove dead code. Dependency and package managers allow to install only the components needed for the operations
of service software, some have the ability to prune unused software out of the codebase once an option is disabled or a
package removed. Third-party software providers possibly give options to what is included in the packaging,
compilation or installation of their software.
Code minimization is assessed in terms of whether the selected method actually helps in minimizing code, to which
extend, and whether the code minimization effort is proportionate to the reduction of the security risk. In assessing this
latter dimension the introduction of ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] can be referred to.


## 5.6.6.1 Test case 5.6-6-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose

- the described code minimization techniques are appropriate for reducing code to the necessary functionality.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.6.7 Test group 5.6-7

## 5.6.7.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.6-7.
Many operating systems for the IoT allow to reduce the privileges necessary for a given piece of software to run. This
approach relies on three principles: separation of duty, need to know, and minimization of privileges. The ability to
minimize privileges depends both on the application of the first two principles and on the functionalities provided by
the hardware and software platform (for example mechanisms such as No eXecute (NX) bit, system calls, accounts,
capabilities, pledge). The principle of need to know goes together with minimization of privilege.

## 5.6.7.1 Test case 5.6-7-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the privilege control mechanisms of the DUT.
Test units
a) The TL shall assess whether all mechanisms to control privileges of software on the DUT in IXIT 17-PrivlCtrl
together facilitate the principles of separation of duty, need to know and minimization of privilege.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:

- the described privilege control mechanisms are adequate to facilitate the principles of separation of duty, need
    to know and minimization of privilege.
The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

## 5.6.8 Test group 5.6-8

## 5.6.8.0 Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.6-8.
Many options exist that can be combined to provide hardware-level access control mechanisms for memory. At the
level of grey-box testing this can be evaluation based on documentation provided by the manufacturer (e.g. schematics,
bill of material, documentation resulting from certification of hardware components) or upon visual inspection of the
board (visual identification of components) and documentation provided by hardware components suppliers.


The objective of this test group is to assess whether the identified hardware-level mechanisms do provide for access
control to memory.

## 5.6.8.1 Test case 5.6-8-1 (conceptual)

whether the mechanism is implemented at the level of the hardware.
NOTE: Implementation at the level of the hardware can include software embedded in the hardware.
b) For each hardware-level access control mechanism for memory in IXIT 18-AccCtrl, the TL shall assess
whether the mechanism allows to control access to memory.
Assignment of verdict

- for every hardware-level access control mechanism for memory, the mechanism is implemented at the level of
    the hardware; and
- for every hardware-level access control mechanism for memory, the mechanism allows to control access to
    memory.

- secure coding techniques; and
- security tolling for the implementation phase; and
- security testing; and
- security reviews; and
- archival of assets and information relevant to maintaining security of the software; and

## Annex C (informative): Sample IXIT

## C.1 Overview

To demonstrate the scope and the level of detail on completing the IXIT pro formas, clause C.3 provides a sample IXIT
on the base of a fictive IoT device a SO can orient on (see Table C.1 to Table C.29).
NOTE 1: The sample IXIT does not provide a set of examples of how to fulfil the provisions of ETSI
TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2], but it represents a sample for a completed IXIT. Therefore it
contains the necessary elements of the IXIT pro formas to enable a feasible assessment by a TL using the
present document. For example implementations fulfilling the provisions of ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI
EN 303 645 [2] please refer to the guide document ETSI TR 103 621 [i.7]. However, the sample IXIT
aims to fulfil the requirements of the provisions of ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2].
NOTE 2: The sample IXIT exemplarily describes some external documents as "attached". Those documents are not
part of the present document.

## C.2 Sample DUT - Fictional IP Camera

This clause provides a brief overview of the sample DUT and its main functionalities used in the sample IXIT.
The DUT for the sample IXIT is a fictional IP camera "IPC 2000" that has real-world functionalities typically and
representative for an IoT device. Its purpose is the recording and playback of video and audio data, e.g. of the user's
estate, which can be viewed through the corresponding app "IP camera App" or the web interface. The IP camera is
connected via LAN or WLAN to the network of the user and can be configured by a local web interface or the app.
Web interface and app provide also the capability of performing firmware updates or user management. To access the
web interface, the user has to complete an authentication process before, using username and password. Moreover the
user can connect to the camera via SSH after enabling this functionality in the configuration. This interface can be used
to copy video files script based or to check log files. The IP camera also offers a SOAP interface that can be used by
other devices to control the movement of the camera and receive audio and video streams via a direct connection.
Connections between IP camera and app are managed by cloud servers of the manufacturer (the cloud infrastructure
represents the associated services of the DUT). There is no direct connection between the app and the IP camera itself.
This infrastructure is contacted when the user decides to submit crash reports or to contact the developer's support. The
cloud servers also provide the firmware updates for the IP camera. Figure C.1 illustrates the example infrastructure.

```
```
Crash logserver User accountserver
```
```
Figure C.1: Infrastructure used for sample IXIT
```
The IP camera provides different update mechanisms to install software updates. The default way is the user initiation
via web interface or app, where the user is also informed about the availability of an update. Alternatively, the user can
attach a USB drive with an update file the user downloaded from the manufacturer's website before. In both cases the
update package is encrypted and the integrity and authenticity are verified before an installation.
On purchasing the camera, the user is provided with a user manual. Additionally the user can find information in the
"Help" section of the app and the manufacturer provides some user information on a product specific area of its website.

```
AuthMech-1 A user can login over HTTPS at port 443 to gain
```
```
access to the web frontend. (A user can request a login over HTTP at port 80 but is forwarded automatically to HTTPS on port 443.) The authentication on the login page is to be completed before any payload data over HTTPS is exchanged. No payload is readable without logging in first. The web server authenticates the given credentials against the login information stored in its SQLite database and grants access to the requested resources. The mechanism is used for user-to-machine authentication. The mechanism is directly addressable from a network interface.
```
```
Username and password (pre-installed and used in initialized state).
```
```
The username is fixed "admin". The password is generated randomly and is unique per device. The password has a length of 16 and consists of upper case chars, lower case chars and numbers. The password is generated by use of /dev/urandom on a UNIX configuration system during manufacturing phase.
```
```
The username and password are transmitted over an HTTPS channel, so the DUT ensures confidentiality and integrity during the transfer.
```
```
Authentication is performed via a form-based HTML interface by an internal PHP script in combination with an SQLite database. Integrity and confidentiality of the password transfer to the DUT is realized over TLS 1.2. The DUT provides per default the following cipher suites for the TLS handshake: ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 or ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384.
```
```
After 3 invalid login attempts the login interface is inaccessible for 5 minutes.
```
```
AuthMech-2 A device can exchange data with the DUT over
```
```
HTTPS/SOAP on port 8085. The authentication via Basic-Auth is confirmed before any payload data over HTTP is exchanged. No payload is readable without providing correct access credentials. The web server authenticates the given credentials against the login information stored in its SQLite database and grants access to the requested resources. The mechanism is used for machine-to-machine authentication. The mechanism is directly addressable from a network interface.
```
```
Username and password (set by user and used in initialized state).
```
```
N/A (Authentication mechanism is password set by the user)
```
```
The username and password are transmitted over an HTTPS channel, so the DUT ensures confidentiality and integrity during the transfer.
```
```
Authentication is performed via an HTTP authentication framework (IETF RFC 7235 [i.8]) by the internal Apache Webserver in combination with an SQLite database. Integrity and confidentiality of the password transfer to the DUT is realized over TLS 1.2 with the TLS cipher suites: ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 or ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384.
```
```
After 10 invalid login attempts user/password combination is disabled for further access.

command line access. The authentication via SSH is confirmed before any payload data over SSH is exchanged. No payload is readable without providing correct access credentials. The SSH server authenticates a given signature against the public keys stored on the file system. (The private key is generated on the DUT the key pair can be downloaded over an HTTPS channel via the web interface.) The mechanism is used for user-to-machine authentication. The mechanism is directly addressable from a network interface.

```
```
With the use of SSH the DUT ensures confidentiality, authenticity and integrity during the transfer.
```
```
Authentication is performed via the SSH protocol (IETF RFC 4253 [i.10]) by the internal SSH server of the DUT. The key pair is built on ECDSA 256 bit and is not protected with a password. Integrity and confidentiality of the SSH credentials to the DUT is realized over SSH2 with cipher suites conformant to the following security parameters: Key exchange: diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256 (2048-bit), encryption: AEAD_AES_256_GCM, MAC: hmac-sha2-256.
```
```
The DUT uses the "fail2ban" framework as unix daemon that scans the system log files for rejected login attempts and dynamically adjusts the firewall rules to drop packets from an attacker's IP address.

update over web interface. The DUT queries the update server https://update.example.net to verify if an update is available. This is done automatically once per day. If an update is available, the DUT notifies the user about it or starts the update automatically, depending on its configuration. When the user or the DUT itself starts the update mechanism, the server delivers the update to the DUT over its network connection. The update package is encrypted using a static symmetric key. The DUT decrypts the update package and then verifies authenticity and integrity of the decrypted update using an asymmetric key and the installation is initiated. Once the update is finished, the user is notified about the successful update.
```
```
The update mechanism provides confidentiality by encrypting the update package. The used encryption key is a hard-coded AES key (which itself is updatable as well) of the update server. The DUT verifies integrity and authenticity of the update file against a hard-coded RSA public key (which itself is updatable as well) of the update server.
```
```
Confidentiality of a software update is realized by an encrypted firmware package based on 10.6028/NIST.FIPS.197. For the decryption AES-CBC with 128 bits is used, in conformance to SOG-IS Crypto Evaluation Scheme Agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms, Version 1.2. Authenticity and integrity of a software update is realized by a signed firmware package based on IETF RFC 8017. For the signature SHA-512 with RSA 4096 bit and OAEP is used, in conformance to SOG-IS Crypto Evaluation Scheme Agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms, Version 1.2. The signing of the firmware package is performed with the private key of the update server. The public key for the update validation is integrated during the manufacturing process of the DUT and is hard-coded in the software. A downgrade attack is prevented by the DUT by verifying that the version of a new firmware package cannot be lower that the version of the currently installed one.
```
```
The DUT checks automatically once a day (the time is chosen randomly for each day) for firmware updates stored at https://update.example.net. The user will be notified when an update is available. The user then can trigger the update by logging in to the web interface and manually starting the update process by pressing the button "Apply update and restart", or the DUT starts the update itself automatically, depending on its configuration. Once the update is started it proceeds without any further user interaction.
```
```
The user can configure the DUT to start an update automatically when available. The default option is that the user is only notified about an update and triggers it manually. In this case the user is asked whether the update should be installed now or on a later date ("install now" or "postpone").
```
```
The DUT contacts the update server at https://update.example.net once per day (the time is chosen randomly for each day). If the server is not reachable, the update check is postponed for 2 hours. The DUT initiates and performs the update check.
```

The user is notified via the app (by push messages) about a pending update. The user is also informed after login on the web interface. The notification contains: • estimated time

The user then can trigger the update by logging in to the web interface and manually pointing the DUT to the update file.

SecBoot-1 The DUT implements a secure boot process. The bootloader is based on
```
```
Trusted Board Boot (TBB), which prevents malicious firmware from running on the platform by authenticating all firmware images up to and including the normal world bootloader. It is done by establishing a Chain of Trust using Public-Key-Cryptography Standards (PKCS). The root of trust is a hardcoded public key that is initially loaded at the DUT's first configuration. The trust key is immutable and cannot be changed. The root of trust together with the RAM chip is certified according to PSA Level 3. A SHA256 of this key is stored into trusted root-key registers. The boot mechanism includes various boot loaders. The
```
```
"boot loader 1
```
```
" (BL1) resides in the ROM so it cannot be tampered with.
```
```
The succeeding other boot loader images BL2, BL31 and BL33 are loaded one after another, where for each BL its integrity is verified by its preceding BL. A chain of trust for the software loaded by the ARM chip is done as described in section "Trusted Board Boot Sequence" at
```
```
https://github.com/ARM-
```
```
software/arm-trusted-firmware/blob/ma
```
```
ster/docs/design/trusted-board-boot.rst
```
```
.
```
```
By establishing a consistent chain of trust, the complete software image including the OS kernel is protected, so that both integrity and authenticity are ensured. The software image is protected against manipulation before booting up.
```
```
If an arbitrary part of the boot loader chain including the software image cannot be verified, the DUT's verification of its boot loaders will fail because the signature check fails. In this case the DUT panics and stops its boot process completely.
```
```
The user will be notified through a red blinking LED at the left side of the DUT when an unauthorized change appears.
```

There are no network functionalities involved.

## Annex D (informative): Additional assessment information

## D.1 Threat model

Threat modelling is widely recognized as one of the most important activities in information systems security. Threat
modelling informs the discovery of actions and sequences thereof that a malicious actor possibly undertakes in order to
impair, detriment, or otherwise compromise the value of an information system.
Threat modelling is concerned with the disciplined development and application of a representation of adversarial
threats, i.e. sources, scenarios, and events specific to those. Such threats can target or affect an asset, be that a device, an
application, a system, a network, a business function (and the corresponding supporting systems), or any other assets as
defined within the scope of concern.
Like any model, a threat model is an abstract representation of the domain that involves threats and the primary
concerns associated to those threats. In this regard, a threat model is used to capture knowledge in a structured manner,
to provide a common language that supports a discourse about that knowledge, and to perform analyses and inference in
the respective domain.
The key concepts of a threat model, include threat events, threat source, threat scenario, and consequences. Alternative
wordings are also possible and frequent in the literature, e.g. the term impact is also used in the place of consequences.
Threats are events that can cause harm to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or information
systems, through unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of information or information systems.
According to ISO/IEC 15408 [i.5], a threat is a potential cause of an incident that can result in harm to a system or
organization. A threat consists of an asset, a threat agent and an adverse action of that threat agent on that asset.
Moreover, a threat is enacted by a threat agent, and can lead to an unwanted incident breaking certain pre-defined
security objectives.
A threat event is a situation that has the potential for causing undesirable consequences or impact upon a particular
piece of information, a particular set of information systems, or both.
A threat scenario is a set of discrete threat events, associated a specific set of one or more threat sources, and which are
partially ordered in time.
Several approaches and techniques for threat modelling are available. The Common Criteria (CC) for security assurance
and evaluation defined in ISO/IEC 15408 [i.5] is one established approach.
The Threat, Vulnerability and Risk Analysis is another standard method used to develop a threat model [i.6]. Threat
Vulnerability and Risk Analysis (TVRA) follows a structured approach through the following steps:
1) Identification of the Target Of Evaluation (TOE) resulting in a high level description of the main assets of the
TOE and the TOE environment and a specification of the goal, purpose and scope of the TVRA.
2) Identification of the objectives resulting in a high level statement of the security aims and issues to be
resolved.
3) Identification of the functional security requirements, derived from the objectives from step 2.
4) Inventory of the assets as refinements of the high level asset descriptions from step 1 and additional assets as a
result of steps 2 and 3.
5) Identification and classification of the vulnerabilities in the system, the threats that potentially exploit them,
and the resulting unwanted incidents.
6) Quantifying the occurrence likelihood and impact of the threats.
7) Establishment of the risks.
8) Identification of countermeasures framework (conceptual) resulting in a list of alternative security services and
capabilities needed to reduce the risk.


```
9) Countermeasure cost-benefit analysis (including security requirements cost-benefit analysis depending on the
scope and purpose of the TVRA) to identify the best fit security services and capabilities amongst alternatives
from step 8.
10) Specification of detailed requirements for the security services and capabilities from step 9.

## D.2 Baseline attacker model........................................................................................................................

## D.2.1 Overview

Many test cases of the present document require an assessment of whether the strength of a security mechanism from
the DUT is sufficient. To facilitate the evaluation, the relevant properties of an attacker on a baseline level are described
in this clause.
In general the present document addresses a baseline security level. It is intended to contribute to the protection of
consumer IoT products against the most common cybersecurity threats especially over network interfaces.
Multi-medium or highly targeted/sophisticated attacks are not in scope. The attacker model is characterized by a
combination of ability and motivation of the attacker.

## D.2.2 Motivation of the attacker

The aim of ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] is that a compliant device is protected against elementary attacks
on fundamental design weaknesses especially concerning network based attacks. A typical attack scenario is that an
attacker intents to compromise a class of devices for the integration into a botnet to attack third parties. The attacker is
not intended to compromise the particular DUT. If the attacker discovers that the DUT has no fundamental
vulnerabilities, he will generally address a different device. Accordingly, the motivation of the attacker is basic to
compromise the DUT.

## D.2.3 Characterization of the attacker

The ability of an attacker is characterized by expertise and resources. It is quantified as attack potential which is
determined by the following factors described in Table D.1.

```
Table D.1: Attacker characterization
Factor Description Baseline Attacker Potential
Elapsed time for identification and
exploitation
```
```
Elapsed time is the total amount of time taken by an
attacker to identify that a particular potential vulnerability
can exist in the DUT, to
develop an attack method and to sustain effort required to
mount the attack against the
DUT.
```
```
The elapsed time is limited to less than one month.
```
```
Expertise Expertise refers to the level of generic knowledge of the
underlying principles, product
type or attack methods.
```
```
The level of expertise is limited to a proficient person that is familiar with the security behaviour of the product type.
```
```
Knowledge of the DUT (design and operation) Knowledge of the DUT refers to specific expertise in relation to
the DUT. This is distinct from
generic expertise, but not unrelated to it.
```
```
The knowledge of the DUT is limited to public information concerning the DUT and information provided to a user,
e.g. user manual. Knowledge that is controlled within the
developer organization and shared with other organizations under a non-disclosure agreement is excluded.
```

```
Factor Description Baseline Attacker Potential
Opportunity Opportunity has a relationship to the elapsed time factor.
Identification or exploitation of
a vulnerability can require considerable amounts of
access to a DUT that can
increase the likelihood of detection. Some attack
methods can require
considerable effort off-line, and only brief access to the DUT to
exploit. Access can also need to be continuous, or over a
number of sessions.
```
```
The opportunity is limited to a moderate level, i.e. access to the DUT is required for less than one month and the
number of DUT samples required to perform the attack is
less than one hundred.
```
```
Equipment required for exploitation Equipment required for exploitation refers to the
acquisition by the attacker.
```
```
Specialized equipment that is not readily available to the attacker, but can be acquired without undue effort and/or at
reasonable cost, forms the upper limit concerning the acquisition. This can include purchase of moderate
amounts of equipment, or development of more extensive
attack scripts or programs.
```
## D.3 Model for a "user with limited technical knowledge"

## D.3.1 Overview

Many test cases of the present document require an assessment of whether the usability of a security-relevant
mechanism from the DUT is given and user documentations are understandable for a common user. To facilitate the
evaluation, the relevant properties of a corresponding user are described in this clause.

## D.3.2 Characterization of a "user with limited technical knowledge"

The following Table D.2 describes assumptions on the ability of a user with limited technical knowledge.

```
Table D.2: User characterization
Factor Description User Potential
Expertise Expertise refers to the level of
generic knowledge of the underlying principles and
product type.
```
```
The level of expertise is limited to baseline expertise
described by the following key data:
```
- The user is able to use a web browser.
- The user able to navigate through the public internet and fill out forms.
- The user knows how to change settings in a smartphone OS.
- The user has baseline security knowledge (e.g. is
    able to use a virus scanner or password, such as a wireless network password).
- The user has baseline knowledge about security updates (e.g. knows the intention, knows that
    updates have to be transmitted/installed and knows the meaning of a support period).
- The user is able to pair devices (e.g. wireless ear plugs with a smartphone).
- The user generally knows what a camera or
    microphone is.


Factor Description User Potential
Knowledge of the DUT Knowledge of the DUT refers to specific expertise in relation
to the DUT. This is distinct
from generic expertise, but not unrelated to it.

The knowledge of the DUT is limited to all information that are provided or referenced together with the DUT (e.g. a
user manual) and what is public available from the website
of the SO. The user knows the intended functionality of the DUT.
Equipment for DUT usage Equipment required for the usage of the DUT. The equipment of the user is limited to what is provided with the DUT (e.g. additional software). Further, the user
possesses a PC or smartphone or gateways and hubs if necessary.
