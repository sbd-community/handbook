## FOREWORD

```
1) The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a worldwide organization for standardization comprising
all national electrotechnical committees (IEC National Committees). The object of IEC is to promote
international co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and electronic fields. To
this end and in addition to other activities, IEC publishes International Standards, Technical Specifications,
Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and Guides (hereafter referred to as “IEC
Publication(s)”). Their preparation is entrusted to technical committees; any IEC National Committee interested
in the subject dealt with may participate in this preparatory work. International, governmental and non-
governmental organizations liaising with the IEC also participate in this preparation. IEC collaborates closely
with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by
agreement between the two organizations.
2) The formal decisions or agreements of IEC on technical matters express, as nearly as possible, an international
consensus of opinion on the relevant subjects since each technical committee has representation from all
interested IEC National Committees.
3) IEC Publications have the form of recommendations for international use and are accepted by IEC National
Committees in that sense. While all reasonable efforts are made to ensure that the technical content of IEC
Publications is accurate, IEC cannot be held responsible for the way in which they are used or for any
misinterpretation by any end user.
4) In order to promote international uniformity, IEC National Committees undertake to apply IEC Publications
transparently to the maximum extent possible in their national and regional publications. Any divergence
between any IEC Publication and the corresponding national or regional publication shall be clearly indicated in
the latter.
5) IEC itself does not provide any attestation of conformity. Independent certification bodies provide conformity
assessment services and, in some areas, access to IEC marks of conformity. IEC is not responsible for any
services carried out by independent certification bodies.
6) All users should ensure that they have the latest edition of this publication.
7) No liability shall attach to IEC or its directors, employees, servants or agents including individual experts and
members of its technical committees and IEC National Committees for any personal injury, property damage or
other damage of any nature whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, or for costs (including legal fees) and
expenses arising out of the publication, use of, or reliance upon, this IEC Publication or any other IEC
Publications.
8) Attention is drawn to the Normative references cited in this publication. Use of the referenced publications is
indispensable for the correct application of this publication.
9) Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this IEC Publication may be the subject of
patent rights. IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

## INTRODUCTION

```
This document is part of a series of standards that addresses the issue of security for
industrial automation and control systems (IACS). This document describes product
development life-cycle requirements related to cyber security for products intended for use in
the industrial automation and control systems environment and provides guidance on how to
meet the requirements described for each element.
```
```
This document has been developed in large part from the Secure Development Life-cycle
Assessment (SDLA) Certification Requirements [26]^1 from the ISA Security Compliance
Institute (ISCI). Note that the SDLA procedure was based on the following sources:
```
- ISO/IEC 15408 -3 (Common Criteria) [18];
- Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Comprehensive, Lightweight Application
    Security Process (CLASP) [36];
- The Security Development Life-cycle by Michael Howard and Steve Lipner [43];
- IEC 6 1508 Functional safety of electrical/electronic/ programmable electronic
    safety-related systems [24], and
- RCTA DO-178B Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification
    [28].

```
Therefore, all these sources can be considered contributing sources to this document.
```
```
This document is the part of the IEC 6 2443 series that contains security requirements for
developers of any automation and control products where security is a concern.
```
```
Figure 1 illustrates the relationship of the different parts of IEC 6 2443 that were in existence
or planned as of the date of circulation of this document. Those that are normatively
referenced are included in the list of normative references in Clause 2, and those that are

capabilities defined in IEC 6 2443-2-4 and to its operation by the asset owner. The product
supplier develops products using a process compliant with this document. Those products
may be a single component, such as an embedded controller, or a group of components
working together as a system or subsystem. The products are then integrated together,
usually by a system integrator, into an Automation Solution using a process compliant with
IEC 6 2443-2-4. The Automation Solution is then installed at a particular site and becomes
part of the industrial automation and control system (IACS). Some of these capabilities
reference security measures defined in IEC 6 2443-3-3 [10] that the service provider ensures
are supported in the Automation Solution (either as product features or compensating
mechanisms). This document only addresses the process used for the development of the
product; it does not address design, installation or operation of the Automation Solution or
IACS.
```
```
In Figure 2, the Automation Solution is illustrated to contain one or more subsystems and
optional supporting components such as advanced control. The dashed boxes indicate that
these components are “optional”.
```
```
NOTE 1 Automation Solutions typically have a single product, but they are not restricted to do so. In some
industries, there may be a hierarchical product structure. In general, the Automation Solution is the set of hardware
and software, independent of product packaging, that is used to control a physical process (for example,
continuous or manufacturing) as defined by the asset owner.

## SECURITY FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION

## AND CONTROL SYSTEMS –

## Part 4-1: Secure product development lifecycle requirements

## 1 Scope

```
This part of IEC 6 2443 specifies process requirements for the secure development of
products used in industrial automation and control systems. It defines a secure development
life-cycle (SDL) for the purpose of developing and maintaining secure products. This life-cycle
includes security requirements definition, secure design, secure implementation (including
coding guidelines), verification and validation, defect management, patch management and
product end-of-life. These requirements can be applied to new or existing processes for
developing, maintaining and retiring hardware, software or firmware for new or existing
products. These requirements apply to the developer and maintainer of the product, but not to
the integrator or user of the product. A summary list of the requirements in this document can
be found in Annex B.
```

permitted by only authorized users according to that policy
```
```
Note 1 to entry: Access control includes identification and authentication requirements specified in other parts of
the IEC 6 2443 series.
```
```

administrator
user who has been authorized to manage security policies/capabilities for a product or system
```
##### 3.1.

```
asset
physical or logical object owned by or under the custodial duties of an organization, having
either a perceived or actual value to the organization
```
```
Note 1 to entry: In this specific case, an asset is an object that is part of an IACS.
```
```
3.1.
asset owner
individual or organization responsible for one or more IACSs

```
Note 1 to entry: Audit logs are used to protect against claims that repudiate responsibility for an action.
```
```
3.1.
authentication
provision of assurance that a claimed characteristic of an identity is correct
```
```
Note 1 to entry: Not all credentials used to authenticate an identity are created equally. The trustworthiness of the
credential is determined by the configured authentication mechanism. Hardware or software-based mechanisms
can force users to prove their identity before accessing data on a device. A typical example is proving the identity
of a user usually through an identity provider.
```
```
Note 2 to entry: Authentication includes verifying human users as well as non-human users such as devices or
processes.
```
```
3.1.
automation solution
control system and any complementary hardware and software components that have been
installed and configured to operate in an IACS
```
```
Note 1 to entry: Automation Solution is used as a proper noun in this part of the IEC 6 2443 series.
```
```
Note 2 to entry: The difference between the control system and the Automation Solution is that the control system
is incorporated into the Automation Solution design (for example, a specific number of workstations, controllers and
devices in a specific configuration), which is then implemented. The resulting configuration is referred to as the
Automation Solution.

##### 3.1.

```
defense in depth
approach to defend the system against any particular attack using several independent
methods
```
```
Note 1 to entry: Defense in depth implies layers of security and detection, even on single systems, and provides
the following features:
```
- is based on the idea that any one layer of protection, may and probably will be defeated;
- attackers are faced with breaking through or bypassing each layer without being detected;
- a flaw in one layer can be mitigated by capabilities in other layers;
- system security becomes a set of layers within the overall network security; and
- each layer should be autonomous and not rely on the same functionality nor have the same failure modes as
    the other layers.

```
3.1.
dependent component
component external to the product on which the product depends
```
```
EXAMPLE Java run time environment or a driver
```
```
Note 1 to entry: This includes both hardware and software.
```
```
3.1.
deprecated function
software method that is supported but whose use is no longer recommended
```
```
Note 1 to entry: Methods are generally deprecated before becoming obsolete (deleted from the set of functions
provided by the supplier of the function). Deprecated functions are sometimes called deprecated methods or
deprecated APIs.

### 3.3 Conventions

```
Requirements defined in this document generally begin with the phrase “A process shall be
employed...”. This terminology is used to specify that the required processes have to be part
of the product suppliers documented product development life-cycle processes. The practice
of these requirements is dependent on the product supplier having product development
projects that require the use of these processes.
```
```
According to 5.5, products requiring the use of these processes shall be identified.
```
## 4 General principles

### 4.1 Concepts

```
The primary goal of these requirements is to provide a framework to address a secure by
design, defense in depth approach to designing, building, maintaining and retiring products
used in industrial automation and control products and systems. Application of the framework
is intended to provide confidence that the component, product or system has security
commensurate with its expected level of risk throughout the product’s life-cycle. While the
concept of security levels is not discussed in this document, complying with this document

```

```

### 5.14 SM-12: Process verification IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018 – 3 –

```
will help ensure that the security capabilities implemented in the product (see IEC 6 2443-4-2^3
[11]) will be implemented correctly and that any known security vulnerabilities in the product
are eliminated or mitigated. Therefore, compliance with this document supports meeting the
overall capability security level (SL-C) of the product.
```
```
The secondary goal of these requirements is to align the development process with the
elevated security needs of product users of Industrial Automation and Control Systems (for
example, providers of IEC 6 2443-2-4 capabilities such as integrators and maintenance
contractors). This means that the process needs to generate items such as well-documented
security configurations and patch management policies and procedures, as well as providing
clear and succinct communications about security vulnerabilities uncovered in the product.
```
```
NOTE 1 For IACS, IEC 6 2443-3-2^4 [9] describes requirements for determining the expected level of risk
associated with the system’s zones and conduits.
```
```
Figure 3 illustrates how secure by design principles in this document contribute to a defense
in depth strategy for the product. The security management practice is shown on the
outermost circle because it is applied throughout all the other practices to ensure that the
practices are being followed and managed. The other practices, shown on the second circle
are applied throughout the development life-cycle, often in an iterative pattern. These
practices each contribute to the overall defense in depth strategy which is shown as the
center of the circle because it represents the key result of following the security development
life-cycle. The defect management and security update management provide verified repairs
to the secure implementation, and fall under the category of overall security management in
the diagram.
```
## Figure 3 – Defence in depth strategy is a key philosophy of the secure product life-cycle

```
A key concept used throughout this document is the use of threat modelling. Design and
implementation reviews to refine work products improve the security posture of a product.
Reviews of any work product (for example, requirements, design records, implemented

modules and verification/validation testing) through any means (for example, manual,
automated or a combination) are used to discover security-related issues in the product. An
impact analysis of each discovered issue assesses its security severity based on its potential
compromise (for example, availability, integrity and confidentiality) and its associated losses
(for example, control of the process, view of the process and intellectual property). Then, the
resolution process determines the most appropriate course of action based on the issue’s
severity and the suitability of various response options.
```
### 4.2 Maturity model

```
There is a range of methods by which a product supplier could comply with the requirements
specified in this document. The maturity model sets benchmarks for meeting these
requirements.
```
```
These benchmarks are defined by maturity levels as shown in Table 1. The maturity levels are
based on the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) for Development (CMMI-DEV)
model [42]. Table 1 shows the relationship to the CMMI-DEV in the description column.
```
```
Maturity levels provide more details on how thoroughly a supplier has met these requirements.
Therefore, these levels can be used by system integrators and asset owners to assess the
level of rigor used to develop products.
```
```
The purpose of the maturity levels described in this subclause is to provide an organization a
benchmark to define their readiness to use their processes and procedures to design and
implement a secure product. Using these benchmarks, it is possible that an organization will
discover that it is not ready to implement all requirements to the same level of maturity.
```
```
When designing, and implementing a secure product according to this document (see
IEC 6 2443-4-2 and IEC 6 2443-3-3), all applicable requirements as defined by SM-5 in this
document shall be followed and used in the development lifecycle of that product regardless
of the maturity level of the organization. SM-5 provides for case-by-case exceptions for
applicability of requirements.
```
```
NOTE 1 Industry groups/sectors identify/select those maturity levels that best meet their individual needs.
```
```
NOTE 2 It is intended that over time and for a specific requirement, a product supplier’s development capabilities
will evolve to higher levels as it gains proficiency in meeting the requirement. The rate of evolution will often vary
for each requirement. For example, a product supplier might reach Level 4 for Practice 6 months or years before
they reach Level 4 for Practice 5.
```
```
NOTE 3 These maturity levels have been defined as a way for organizations to measure and report their
compliance to this document. This model will allow organizations to evolve to higher (more mature) levels of
capabilities for their processes.
```
```
NOTE 4 Measurement driven continuous improvement is vital for improving the maturity level of a product
supplier for each practice in this document. In addition, since best practices for secure product development are
evolving, product suppliers need to seek out and implement new best practices.

## Table 1 – Maturity levels

```
Level CMMI-DEV IEC 6 2443-4-1 IEC 6 2443-4-1 Description
1 Initial Initial Product suppliers typically perform product development in an ad-
hoc and often undocumented (or not fully documented) manner. As a
result, consistency across projects and repeatability of processes
may not be possible.
2 Managed Managed At this level, the product supplier has the capability to manage the
development of a product according to written policies (including
objectives). The product supplier also has evidence to show that
personnel who will perform the process have the expertise, are
trained and/or follow written procedures to perform it.
However, at this level, the organization does not have experience
developing products to all of the written policies. This would be the
case when the organization has updated its procedures to conform
to this document, but has not yet put all of the procedures into
actual practice, yet.
The development discipline reflected by maturity level 2 helps to
ensure that development practices are repeatable, even during
times of stress. When these practices are in place, their execution
will be performed and managed according to their documented
plans.
NOTE At this level, the CMMI and IEC 6 2443-4-1 maturity models
are fundamentally the same, with the exception that IEC 6 2443-4- 1
recognizes that there may be a significant delay between
defining/formalizing a process and executing (practicing) it.
Therefore, the execution related aspects of the CMMI-DEV Level 2
are deferred to Level 3.
3 Defined Defined
(Practiced)
```
```
The performance of a level 3 product supplier can be shown to be
repeatable across the supplier’s organization. The processes have
been practiced, and evidence exists to demonstrate that this has
occurred.
NOTE At this level, the CMMI and IEC 6 2443-4-1 maturity models
are fundamentally the same, with the exception that the execution
related aspects of the CMMI-DEV level 2 are included here.
Therefore, a process at level 3 is a level 2 process that the supplier
has practiced for at least one product.

## 5 Practice 1 – Security management

### 5.1 Purpose

```
The purpose of the security management practice is to ensure that the security-related
activities are adequately planned, documented and executed throughout the product’s
life-cycle.
```
```
If care is not taken in planning and supporting the activities related to security, then those
activities can be rendered ineffective due to inadequate resources, insufficient time or process
inefficiencies. Similarly, misalignment of the product’s security needs with related
organizational processes such as configuration management, information technology policies
and procedures and supply chain management can jeopardize the effectiveness of the secure
product development life-cycle.

### 5.2 SM-1: Development process

#### 5.2.1 Requirement

```
A general product development/maintenance/support process shall be documented and
enforced that is consistent and integrated with commonly accepted product development
processes that include, but are not limited to:
```
```
a) configuration management with change controls and audit logging;
b) product description and requirements definition with requirements traceability;
c) software or hardware design and implementation practices, such as modular design;
d) repeatable testing verification and validation process;
e) review and approval of all development process records; and
f) life-cycle support.
```
### 5.3 Rationale and supplemental guidance

```
This process is required to ensure that the product supplier has well-defined and proven
product development processes in place that can be extended to support the requirements
specified by this document. The required processes defined by this document assume the
existence of a mature product development life-cycle. Secure product development life-cycles
cannot be effective without these processes and rely upon them being in place. Examples of
commonly accepted product development processes include ISO 9001 [13] and
ISO/IEC 27034 [34] compliant processes.
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier uses techniques during the product
development life-cycle that support, as a minimum, configuration management, requirements
definition, design, implementation and testing.
```
### 5.4 SM-2: Identification of responsibilities

#### 5.4.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed that identifies the organizational roles and personnel responsible
for each of the processes required by this document.
```
#### 5.4.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that responsibilities are assigned to elements of the
product supplier's organization for performing and completing the processes required by this
document.
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier's development, maintenance and product
support processes required by this document each identify the organizational roles and
personnel that are responsible for performing and completing them. The organization and
personnel can be within the developer’s organization or external to it.
```
```
NOTE A responsible, accountable, consulted and informed (RACI) matrix is an example of a tool that could be
used to meet this requirement.
```
### 5.5 SM-3: Identification of applicability

#### 5.5.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for identifying products (or parts of products) to which this
document applies.
```

```

```

##### – 22 – IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018

#### 5.5.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that the processes in scope as part of this document are
applied to the appropriate products as needed and that the correct level of detail is applied.
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier has criteria for identifying which of its
products are to be developed, maintained and supported using the processes required by this
document. It is envisioned that a product supplier may apply this specification to selected
products based on a number of factors, including the marketplace for which a product is
intended and whether or not the product requires security to be built into the product and fully
evaluated. As an example, certain products or components may not have a security context or
provide anonymous access and therefore may not require security to be built into the product.
An organization may also base the criteria on the particular features being developed to
enhance a product for target markets as long as the common features for all markets remain
subject to this standard. Organizations may also use criteria such as applicable security
requirements or security risk.
```
```
These requirements may be applied to externally provided components or custom developed
components from third party suppliers. See 5.11 and 5.12 for more details.
```
### 5.6 SM-4: Security expertise

#### 5.6.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for identifying and providing security training and assessment
programs to ensure that personnel assigned to the organizational roles and duties specified in
5.4, have demonstrated security expertise appropriate for those processes.
```
#### 5.6.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that personnel involved in security-related processes have
adequate expertise for the specific tasks to which they are assigned. Expertise can have been
gained by training, experience, seminars, conferences, certifications, etc. This includes
technical expertise in defense in depth strategies and related security techniques, and also in
the practices, including best practices, required to develop and maintain the product.
```
```
Having this process means that personnel assigned to security-related processes have
evidence that shows their relevant qualifications. This includes knowledge not only of security,
but also for the use of any security-related standards (for example, coding standards),
techniques (for example, best practices), and tools (for example, static analysis tools). While
security awareness training is vital for everyone involved in the secure product life-cycle, it is
generally insufficient for personnel involved in security requirements analysis, design reviews,
etc. The security training is role-specific and can vary in formality from informal to formal.
Similarly, the personnel assigned to security-related processes have experience (for example,
past projects and number of years) that matches the specific security tasks and their specific
role.
```
### 5.7 SM-5: Process scoping

#### 5.7.1 Requirement

```
A process, that includes justification by documented security analysis, shall be employed to
identify the parts of this document that are applicable to a selected product development
project. Justification for scoping the level of compliance of a project to this document shall be
subject to review and approval by personnel with the appropriate security expertise (see 5.6).

#### 5.7.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Examples include:
```
```
a) The product does not include software therefore process requirements applicable to
software are out of scope.
b) The threat model indicates that the product does not have any external interfaces or
sources of untrusted input (for example, a product with no external connections that can
only be accessed in a room with high physical security). In this case, for example, the
requirement for fuzz testing external interfaces would not apply.
```
### 5.8 SM-6: File integrity

#### 5.8.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed to provide an integrity verification mechanism for all scripts,
executables and other important files included in a product.
```
#### 5.8.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that product users can verify that executables, scripts, and
other important files received from the supplier have not been altered. Common methods of
meeting this requirement include cryptographic hashes and digital signatures (which also
provide proof of origin).
```
### 5.9 SM-7: Development environment security

#### 5.9.1 Requirement

```
A process that includes procedural and technical controls shall be employed for protecting the
product during development, production and delivery. This includes protecting the product or
product update (patch) during design, implementation, testing and release.
```
#### 5.9.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that the product has not been altered or disclosed in any
way during the development process, unless allowed by policy. Loss of integrity of any aspect
of the development environment (e.g., the product design and implementation, code signing
infrastructure, and software build environment) can negatively affect fielded versions of the
product without the knowledge of the organization or its customers. For example, the ability of
an attacker to insert an infection in the binary code of a product could lead to that infection
being distributed as part of the released product.
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier has mechanisms in place to protect the
integrity of design documents, the product implementation (for example, code and user
manuals), configuration settings and private keys used for signing software images. For
example, application of ISO/IEC 27001 [20] and ISO/IEC 27002 [19] policies and controls can
reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access to source code or corruption of source code.
They can also reduce the likelihood of unauthorized disclosure of product designs and test
results that could be used to compromise fielded versions of the product. Items to specially
safeguard include authenticators (e.g., passwords, access control lists, code signing
certificates and exploit records collected during defect management).
```
### 5.10 SM-8: Controls for private keys

#### 5.10.1 Requirement

```
The supplier shall have procedural and technical controls in place to protect private keys used
for code signing from unauthorized access or modification.
```
## Española

## de

## Normalización,

## UNE






```

```

##### – 24 – IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018

#### 5.10.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Private keys are the root of trust, so they require extra protection to ensure that they are not
stolen or modified.
```
### 5.11 SM-9: Security requirements for externally provided components

#### 5.11.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed to identify and manage the security risks of all externally
provided components used within the product.
```
#### 5.11.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that supply chain security is addressed for equivalent
security practices, latest security updates, security deployment guides and the supplier’s
ability to respond if a vulnerability is discovered. Supply chain security applies to components
which are included within the product and are provided external to the development team
responsible for a given product, but do not meet the definition described in 5.12. The security
provided by such third-party components is directly related to their role in the product's secure
design and defense in depth strategy (see Clause 7).
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier is able to identify when one or more of
the following characteristics apply to the use of third-party components in the product:
```
```
a) the degree to which the component aligns with the product’s security context (see
Clause 6) and defense in depth strategy (see Clause 7);
b) the degree of rigor applied to the component’s implementation (see Clause 8);
c) the degree of security verification and validation performed on the component by the
product supplier or the component supplier (see Clause 9);
d) how to receive and/or monitor notifications about security-related issues from the
component supplier (see Clause 10) and patches (see Clause 11 ); and
e) the sufficiency of security documentation for the component (see Clause 12 ).
f) the degree that the software is currently supported by the supplier or open source
community.
```
```
Examples of work items that would satisfy some elements of this requirement include:
```
- identifying known vulnerabilities in specific versions of open source software components
    and updating the version of the open source components to the version that fixes the
    vulnerability;
- evaluating the compliance of vendors of commercial off the shelf (COTS) components to
    this document or a similar SDL standard; and
- employing compensating mechanisms for known vulnerabilities on COTS or open source
    components (such as static code analysis).

```
It is recommended that there be an inventory of components from third party suppliers in
order to facilitate defect management (see Clause 6).
```
```
For related supply chain requirements, see ISO/IEC 27036 -3 [21].
```
### 5.12 SM-10: Custom developed components from third-party suppliers

#### 5.12.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed to ensure that product development life-cycle processes for
components from a third-party supplier conform to the requirements used in this document
when they meet the following criteria:
```
## Española

## de

## Normalización,

## UNE






```

```

##### IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018 – 25 –

```
a) the components are developed specifically for a single supplier for a specific purpose; and
b) the components can have an impact on security.
```
#### 5.12.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This requirement applies when a supplier subcontracts a third-party to specifically develop a
component for them which can have security implications. Threat modelling is usually used to
determine which components will have security implications.
```
### 5.13 SM-11: Assessing and addressing security-related issues

#### 5.13.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for verifying that a product or a patch is not released until its
security-related issues have been addressed and tracked to closure (see 10.5). This includes
issues associated with:
```
```
a) requirements (see Clause 6);
b) secure by design (see Clause 7);
c) implementation (see Clause 8);
d) verification/validation (see Clause 9); and
e) defect management ( see Clause 10).
```
#### 5.13.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that the product is not released with security-related issues
that have been discovered and whose resolution is not complete and whose severity as
defined by a vulnerability scoring system, such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS), is calculated as above the residual risk acceptable within the product security context.
```
```
Having this process means that any security-related issue identified during the development
and support of a product is documented and addressed to allow the effective security of the
product to be determined prior to product release. This would include issues found in all
phases such as design review, code review, verification and validation testing, use of static
analysis tools, etc.
```
```
5.14 SM-12: Process verification
```
#### 5.14.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for verifying that, prior to product release, all applicable
security-related processes required by this specification (see 5.7) have been completed with
records documenting the completion of each process.
```
#### 5.14.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that key security practices are being executed.
```
### 5.15 SM-13: Continuous improvement

#### 5.15.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for continuously improving the SDL. This process shall include
the analysis of security defects in component/subsystem/system technologies that escape to
the field.
```
## Española

## Normalización,

## UNE






```

```

##### – 26 – IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018

#### 5.15.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that product suppliers improve the rigor of their SDL over
time. New security threats are constantly being identified and exploited by attackers so it is
important product suppliers help compensate for this by continuously improving their SDL.
```
```
Continuous improvement is a well-established and proven method of improving product
quality. Since product security issues are a type of quality issue, continuous improvement
methodologies are applicable to an SDL. See Annex A for potential metrics related to SDL
effectiveness and improvement.
```
```
Having this process means that the supplier has a procedure in place to review the process
and security defects that escape to the field on a periodic basis and that this procedure
includes making improvements to the process as a result of these reviews.
```
```
Some examples of activities that would help improve a product supplier’s SDL are included in
Table 2. Ultimately it is up to suppliers to implement their own means of continuously
improving their SDL.
```
## Table 2 – Example SDL continuous improvement activities

```
Activity SDL / Security benefits
Use a known security vulnerability database to help
improve the threat model. For example, if the threat
model indicates that the product uses the TLS protocol
for transport security, review known vulnerabilities in
TLS implementations and ensure these are mitigated in
the design.
```
```
Improves the threat model by keeping it current with
actual security issues observed in the field.
```
```
Attend external security / SDL conferences or
participate in industry SDL groups such as OWASP
```
```
Helps a product supplier stay current with emerging
threats and SDL best practices.
Conduct internal SDL conferences or sessions for
sharing of SDL expertise and best practices within the
product supplier’s organization.
```
```
Improve the overall SDL expertise of the product
supplier’s employees and help them stay current with
emerging security threats and SDL best practices.
Perform SDL root cause analysis for security
vulnerabilities found externally in a supplier’s product
and identify plus implement corrective action. All SDL
practices should be in scope for this analysis.
```
```
Root cause analysis and corrective action is a well-
established method for improving product quality.
Since security issues are quality issues it works well
for an SDL too.
Combine manual penetration testing with automated tool
base testing or use multiple similar security testing tools
for SVV-3 Vulnerability testing.
```
```
Improves test coverage relative to using a single
automated tool. This becomes especially valuable
after the existing automated tool stops finding new
vulnerabilities.
Create fuzzing tools for any protocols for which tools
are not available.
```
```
Help avoid the scenario where an attacker develops
its own fuzzing tool and uses it to find and exploit
security vulnerabilities in a product.
Train and use dedicated security testing experts for
SVV-3 Vulnerability testing.
```
```
Since security vulnerability requires extensive and
constantly growing expertise, developing and using
dedicated experts will improve security test
coverage.
```
## 6 Practice 2 – Specification of security requirements

### 6.1 Purpose

```
The processes specified by this practice are used to document the security capabilities that
are required for a product along with the expected product security context. Security
capabilities can include such items as authentication, authorization, encryption, auditing and
other security capabilities a product needs to include. The product security context can
include items such as physical security level, protection of external interfaces via a firewall,
etc. See [10] for more information on security capability requirements.
```
## Española

## de

## Normalización,

## UNE






```

```

## – 4 – IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC

```
These security requirements can be defined at the product-level or they may supplement
product-level requirements.
```
### 6.2 SR-1: Product security context

#### 6.2.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed to ensure that the intended product security context is
documented.
```
#### 6.2.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that the minimum requirements of the environment and the
assumptions about that environment are documented in order to achieve the security level for
which the product was designed. The purpose of defining this information is so that both the
developers of the product and the product users have the same understanding about how the
product is intended to be used. This will help the developers make appropriate design
decisions and the users to use the product as it was intended. Security context could include:
```
```
a) location in the network;
b) physical or cyber security provided by the environment where the product will be deployed;
c) isolation (from a network perspective); and
d) if known, potential impact to the environment (for example, loss of life, injury, loss of
production, etc.).
```
```
For example, it is important to document whether physical security is required. If no physical
security is expected to be present, then that may add a number of related requirements such
as not allowing pushbutton configuration on the product. Another example is if the product is
expected to be protected by a user supplied firewall that connects it to the plant network, the
product would typically not require a firewall of its own. Documenting these external security
features for the product (its security context) allows developers to design a defense in depth
strategy that complements this security context and testers to validate and verify the security
of a product in an environment similar to how it should be deployed.
```
```
Having this process means that the deployment environment in which the product is intended
to be used is correctly represented in all processes involved in the development and testing of
this product and are documented.
```
### 6.3 SR-2: Threat model

#### 6.3.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed to ensure that all products shall have a threat model specific to
the current development scope of the product with the following characteristics (where
applicable):
```
```
a) correct flow of categorized information throughout the system;
b) trust boundaries;
c) processes;
d) data stores;
e) interacting external entities;
f) internal and external communication protocols implemented in the product;
g) externally accessible physical ports including debug ports;
h) circuit board connections such as Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) connections or debug
headers which might be used to attack the hardware;
i) potential attack vectors including attacks on the hardware, if applicable;
```

```

##### – 28 – IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018

```
j) potential threats and their severity as defined by a vulnerability scoring system (for
example, CVSS);
k) mitigations and/or dispositions for each threat;
l) security-related issues identified; and
m) external dependencies in the form of drivers or third-party applications (code that is not
developed by the supplier) that are linked into the application.
```
```
The threat model shall be reviewed and verified by the development team to ensure that it is
correct and understood.
```
```
The threat model shall be reviewed periodically (at least once a year) for released products
and updated if required in response to the emergence of new threats to the product even if
the design does not change.
```
```
Any issues identified in the threat model shall be addressed as defined in 10.4 and 10.5.
```
#### 6.3.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that security threats for the product are identified, validated,
documented, addressed and tested by the product's project team according to the defense in
depth strategy.
```
```
Having this process means that a threat model for the product is defined and maintained
throughout the product life-cycle ( for example, as a result of changing threats or updates to
the defense in depth strategy) that identifies and describes threats that can occur within the
product security context, and against which product is expected to defend itself.
```
```
External dependencies are external components or systems that the product depends upon
for security. As an example, a product could depend on power for physical security. Or a
product could depend on the session management of a web server to be secure. In these
examples, failure of the external dependency could lead to a security vulnerability in the
product, so mitigations need to be put in place to minimize the chances of such failures. So
for the power example, the mitigation could be the installation of an uninterruptable power
supply (UPS). In the example of a web server, security should be considered when choosing a
web server, and if a secure web server cannot be found, then other compensating measures
need to be considered.
```
```
Third-party code is an external dependency that can present significant challenges in
determining where the threats can occur. If deeply embedded there might not be access
to/from this code that crosses a trust boundary. If there is access to the trust boundary, a
deeper inspection of the third-party code can be needed.
```
### 6.4 SR-3: Product security requirements

#### 6.4.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for ensuring that security requirements are documented for the
product/feature under development including requirements for security capabilities related to
installation, operation, maintenance and decommissioning.
```
#### 6.4.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that security requirements specific to the product are
defined. This includes both technical security requirements (for example, password complexity)
and business-oriented security requirements (for example, sensitive data, user authorizations
and separation of duties).
```
## Española

## de

## Normalización,

## UNE






```

```

##### IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018 – 29 –

```
Having this process means that the product supplier defines and documents all product
security requirements that apply to the life-cycle of the product, including:
```
```
a) security privileges required to install, operate, and maintain the product;
b) security options, including removal of default passwords, used to install, configure,
operate and maintain the product; and
c) security considerations/actions associated with removing the product from use (for
example, removing sensitive data).
```
```
NOTE For different capability security levels (SL-C 1 through SL-C 4), IEC 6 2443-3-3 and IEC 6 2443-4-2 [11]
define the security capability requirements for control systems and components, respectively. These security
capabilities are then included as product security requirements for products that are to include these capabilities.
```
### 6.5 SR-4: Product security requirements content

#### 6.5.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for ensuring that security requirements include the following
information:
```
```
a) the scope and boundaries of the component or system, in general terms in both a physical
and a logical way; and
b) the required capability security level (SL-C) of the product.
```
#### 6.5.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
If the product is targeted to meet a certain security capability level, it is important to document
this as a requirement because it implies that certain security capabilities need to be included
in the product. Note that capability security levels and required security capabilities for
products are defined in IEC 6 2443-4-2 [11] and IEC 6 2443-3-3 [10].
```
### 6.6 SR-5: Security requirements review

#### 6.6.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed to ensure that security requirements are reviewed, updated as
necessary and approved to ensure clarity, validity, alignment with the threat model (discussed
in 6.3), and their ability to be verified. Each of the following representative disciplines shall
participate in this process. Personnel may be assigned to more than one discipline except for
testers, who shall remain independent:
```
```
a) architects/developers (those who will implement the requirements);
b) testers (those who will validate that the requirements have been met);
c) customer advocate (such as sales, marketing, product management or customer support);
and
d) security advisor.
```
#### 6.6.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that security requirements are valid, understood and
testable (or otherwise verifiable).
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier conducts reviews of all security
requirements and revises/deletes those that are invalid or that are untestable/unverifiable.

## 7 Practice 3 – Secure by design

### 7.1 Purpose

```
The processes specified by this practice are used to ensure that the product is secure by
design including defense in depth. Defense in depth provides one or more layers of security to
thwart security threats. Each layer of the defense in depth strategy is designed to protect the
assets from attack in the case that all other layers have been compromised.
```
```
The processes required by this practice are required to be applied to all stages of product
design, from conceptual design to detailed design, and to all levels of product design from the
overall architecture to the design of individual components.
```
### 7.2 SD-1: Secure design principles

#### 7.2.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for developing and documenting a secure design that identifies
and characterizes each interface of the product, including physical and logical interfaces, to
include:
```
```
a) an indication of whether the interface is externally accessible (by other products), or
internally accessible (by other components of the product), or both;
b) security implications of the product security context (see Clause 6) on the external
interface;
c) potential users of the interface and the assets that can be accessed through it (directly or
indirectly);
d) a determination of whether access to the interface crosses a trust boundary;
e) security considerations, assumptions and/or constraints associated with the use of the
interface within the product security context, including applicable threats;
f) the security roles, privileges/rights and access control permissions needed to use the
interface and to access the assets defined in c) above;
g) the security capabilities and/or compensating mechanisms used to safeguard the interface
and the assets defined in c) above, including input validation as well as output and error
handling;
h) the use of third-party products to implement the interface and their security capabilities;
i) documentation that describes how to use the interface if it is externally accessible; and
j) description of how the design mitigates the threats identified in the threat model.
```
#### 7.2.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that security for access to assets is comprehensively
addressed from the perspective of external and internal interfaces of the product through
which attacks can be mounted.
```
```
Having this process means that interfaces of the product are identified and characterized by
the interactions that take place over them (for example, data and control flows), the security
mechanisms designed to protect them and the assets that can be compromised if not
adequately protected. Interfaces include physical and wireless connections to networks (for
example, Ethernet) and devices (for example, keyboards, monitors and USB/compact disc
[CD]/ digital versatile disc [DVD] media). Logical interfaces support data control flows (for
example, application messaging) between product components and include mechanisms such
as application programming interfaces (for example, structured query language [SQL]) and
communications protocols (for example, the transmission control protocol [TCP]). Protection
mechanisms include general hardening capabilities (for example, security policy settings),
user access controls (for example, account management), and security event detection and
reporting, among others.

```
Viewing interfaces within the setting provided by the product security context allows the
secure design to focus on the specific environment in which the product is expected to
operate, including both protections offered by the product security context and vulnerabilities
resulting from it (for example, where it can be open to attack). For an internal component of
the design, the concept of the product security context is extended to include the security
context provided by surrounding product components. For example, the product security
context of an application program running on a workstation that is part of an industrial control
system product includes the network(s) to which the workstation connects and the software
environment of the workstation in which the application runs.
```
```
Identifying threats, users, assets and trust boundaries associated with interfaces specifies
who is expected to use the interfaces, and indicates where threats and unknown subjects
potentially can gain access to the interface and the assets that can be accessed through it.
This allows the reduction of the number of interfaces where possible and to provide the
appropriate safeguards for the remaining interfaces and the assets that can be accessed
through them. Identifying trust boundaries also supports future definition of zones and
conduits (see IEC 6 2443-3-2 [9]), and thus is a primary component in the definition of the
security architecture of the product. Sample data assets (resources) include:
```
```
a) databases and database tables;
b) configuration files;
c) cryptographic key stores;
d) access control lists (ACLs);
e) registry keys;
f) web pages (static and dynamic);
g) audit logs;
h) network sockets / network media;
i) inter-process communications (IPC), services and remote procedure call (RPC) resources;
j) any other files and directories; and
k) any other memory resource.
```
```
Based on analysis of the product security requirements, the product security context and trust
boundary considerations, the design can be developed for interfaces that include the
definition of user roles, privileges and authorization/access permissions required to use the
interfaces as well as specific security capabilities (for example, authentication, encryption and
logging) that provide additional safeguards. As part of the design of the defense in depth
strategy, the expected use of compensating mechanisms and third-party hardware or software
components will aid in the assessment of the adequacy of the defense in depth strategy
(see 7.4).
```
```
Finally, preparing documentation for the use of externally accessible interfaces (for example,
by users and third-parties) reduces the potential for accidental misuse.
```
### 7.3 SD-2: Defense in depth design..............................................................................

#### 7.3.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed to implement multiple layers of defense using a risk based
approach based on the threat model. This process shall be employed for assigning
responsibilities to each layer of defense.
```
```
NOTE 1 Each layer provides additional defense mechanisms.
```
```
NOTE 2 It is possible for any layer to be compromised; therefore, secure design principles (see 7.2) are applied
to each layer.
```
```
NOTE 3 The objective is to reduce the attack surface of the subsequent layers.

```

##### – 32 – IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018

#### 7.3.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
For example, the TCP/IP stack could check for invalid packets, an HTTP server could
authenticate input and then another layer could validate that the input and audit logs are
produced for administrative changes. Each layer provides an additional defense mechanism,
has a responsibility and provides attack surface reduction for the next layer. Each layer
assumes that the layer in front of it can be compromised.
```
### 7.4 SD-3: Security design review

#### 7.4.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for conducting design reviews to identify, characterize and track
to closure security-related issues associated with each significant revision of the secure
design including but not limited to:
```
```
a) security requirements (see Clause 6) that were not adequately addressed by the design;
```
```
NOTE 1 Requirements allocation, including security requirements, is part of typical design processes.
b) threats and their ability to exploit product interfaces, trust boundaries, and assets
(see 7.2); and
c) identification of secure design practices ( see 7.5) that were not followed (for example,
failure to apply principle of least privilege).
```
```
NOTE 2 Characterizing threats and their ability to exploit interfaces is often referred to as threat modelling.
```
#### 7.4.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that the secure design addresses the requirements and
threats (see Clause 6) defined for the product, and that design best practices have been
followed (see 7.5). All discovered security-related issues are to be documented and tracked
through the processes defined by 7.4 and 10.5.
```
```
Having this process means that each version of the design is reviewed to determine:
```
```
a) whether any product security requirements have not been adequately addressed by the
defense in depth strategy; and
b) whether there are threat vectors (paths for threats to follow) that bypass the defense in
depth strategy or that are otherwise capable of breaching the defense in depth strategy.
```
```
In either case, the threat model is to be updated to reflect security-related issues discovered
as a result of the review process.
```
### 7.5 SD-4: Secure design best practices

#### 7.5.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed to ensure that secure design best practices are documented and
applied to the design process. These practices shall be periodically reviewed and updated.
Secure design practices include but are not limited to:
```
```
a) least privilege (granting only the privileges to users/software necessary to perform
intended operations);
b) using proven secure components/designs where possible;
c) economy of mechanism (striving for simple designs);
d) using secure design patterns;
e) attack surface reduction;
f) documenting all trust boundaries as part of the design; and
```

```
g) removing debug ports, headers and traces from circuit boards used during development
from production hardware or documenting their presence and the need to protect them
from unauthorized access.
```
#### 7.5.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that guidance is provided to developers to help them avoid
common pitfalls during design that could lead to later security issues.
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier has a list of security best practices that is
maintained and followed during the development of the secure design for the product. These
best practices should be based commonly accepted security best practices in industry for the
type of product being developed. It is completely up to the supplier to determine which
practices they consider to be most appropriate for their design practices. These practices are
kept current as a result of both changes in the industry and the application of lessons learned
by the product supplier.
```
```
Note that these practices apply to both hardware and software design.
```
## 8 Practice 4 – Secure implementation

### 8.1 Purpose

```
The processes specified by this practice are used to ensure that the product features are
implemented securely.
```
### 8.2 Applicability

```
Requirements in this practice apply to all hardware and software components in the product
with the exception of externally provided components. For externally provided components,
requirement 5.11 applies instead.
```
### 8.3 SI-1: Security implementation review

#### 8.3.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed to ensure that implementation reviews are performed for
identifying, characterizing and tracking to closure security-related issues associated with the
implementation of the secure design including:
```
```
a) identification of security requirements (see Clause 6) that were not adequately addressed
by the implementation;
```
```
NOTE Requirements allocation, including security requirements, is part of typical design processes.
b) identification of secure coding standards ( see 8.4) that were not followed (for example,
use of banned functions or failure to apply principle of least privilege);
c) Static Code Analysis (SCA) for source code to determine security coding errors such as
buffer overflows, null pointer dereferencing, etc. using the secure coding standard for the
supported programming language. SCA shall be done using a tool if one is available for
the language used. In addition, static code analysis shall be done on all source code
changes including new source code.
d) review of the implementation and its traceability to the security capabilities defined to
support the security design (see Clause 7); and
e) examination of threats and their ability to exploit implementation interfaces, trust
boundaries and assets (see 7.2 and 7.3).

##### – 34 – IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018

#### 8.3.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that the implementation properly addresses (implements)
the secure design and its associated security requirements and follows implementation best
practices.
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier conducts a comprehensive set of security
reviews of the implementation and its design. Different types of reviews will typically be used
to address different objectives. For example, manual reviews are typically conducted against
the implementation design to verify that requirements are being met and that the
implementation will adequately protect against threats expected to be present. In addition,
manual source code reviews may be used to examine source code for adherence to best
practices (see 8.4), and automated static source code analysis may be used to identify
anomalies, including security vulnerabilities in the code as well as non-conformities with given
programming rules.
```
### 8.4 SI-2: Secure coding standards

#### 8.4.1 Requirement

```
The implementation processes shall incorporate security coding standards that are
periodically reviewed and updated and include at a minimum:
```
```
a) avoidance of potentially exploitable implementation constructs – implementation design
patterns that are known to have security weaknesses;
b) avoidance of banned functions and coding constructs/design patterns – software functions
and design patterns that should not be used because they have known security
weaknesses;
c) automated tool use and settings (for example, for static analysis tools);
d) secure coding practices;
e) validation of all inputs that cross trust boundary.
f) error handling.
```
#### 8.4.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that guidance is provided to developers to help them avoid
common pitfalls during implementation that could lead to later security issues.
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier has a list of security best practices that it
maintains and follows during the implementation of a product. These best practices should be
based on commonly accepted security best practices in industry for the type of product being
developed. It is completely up to the supplier to determine which practices they consider to be
most appropriate for their design and coding standard. These practices are kept current as a
result of both changes in the industry and the application of lessons learned by the product
supplier.
```
## 9 Practice 5 – Security verification and validation testing

### 9.1 Purpose

```
The processes specified by this practice are used to document the security testing required to
ensure that all the security requirements have been met for the product and that security of
the product is maintained when it is used in its product security context and configured to
employ its defense in depth strategy.
```
```
Security testing can be performed at various times by various personnel during the SDL
based on the type of testing and the development model used by the vendor. For example,
```
## Española

## de

## Normalización,

## UNE






```

```

##### IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018 – 35 –

```
fuzz testing could be performed during software development by the software development
team and later in the cycle by a test team.
```
```
Issues uncovered by testing will be addressed as per “Practice 6 – Security defect
management”.
```
### 9.2 SVV-1: Security requirements testing

#### 9.2.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for verifying that the product security functions meet the security
requirements and that the product handles error scenarios and invalid input correctly. Types
of testing shall include:
```
```
a) functional testing of security requirements;
b) performance and scalability testing; and
c) boundary/edge condition, stress and malformed or unexpected input tests not specifically
targeted at security.
```
#### 9.2.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that the product meets the security requirements defined
for it (see Clause 6).
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier verifies through testing that the product
meets its documented security requirements.
```
```
Examples of the types of functionality in scope for security requirements include:
```
```
a) general security capabilities (features);
b) API (application programming interface);
c) permission delegation;
d) anti-tampering and integrity functionality;
e) signed image verification; and
f) secure storage of secrets.
```
### 9.3 SVV-2: Threat mitigation testing

#### 9.3.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for testing the effectiveness of the mitigation for the threats
identified and validated in the threat model. Activities shall include:
```
```
a) creating and executing plans to ensure that each mitigation implemented to address a
specific threat has been adequately tested to ensure that the mitigation works as designed;
and
b) creating and executing plans for attempting to thwart each mitigation.
```
#### 9.3.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
The effectiveness of mitigations to threats identified by the threat model are tested as part of
this practice. Examples of threat mitigation testing include attempts to thwart mitigations
identified using the spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service
and elevation of privilege (STRIDE). For example, if STRIDE identified authentication as a
mitigation for spoofing threat mitigation tests would focus on bypassing authentication.
```
```
If a layered defense strategy is used as a mitigation, then the effectiveness of each layer
would be tested. For example, if the product employs the combination of authentication,
```
## Española

## de

## Normalización,

## UNE






```

```

##### – 36 – IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018

```
authorization and audit logs as a layered defense strategy to thwart tampering, then each
layer will be tested for its contribution to this mitigation strategy.
```
```
This process is required to ensure that the product’s defense in depth and threat mitigation
strategies and capabilities are effective.
```
### 9.4 SVV-3: Vulnerability testing

#### 9.4.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for performing tests that focus on identifying and characterizing
potential security vulnerabilities in the product. Known vulnerability testing shall be based
upon, at a minimum, recent contents of an established, industry-recognized, public source for
known vulnerabilities. Testing shall include:
```
```
a) abuse case or malformed or unexpected input testing focused on uncovering security
issues. This shall include manual or automated abuse case testing and specialized types
of abuse case testing on all external interfaces and protocols for which tools exist.
Examples include fuzz testing and network traffic load testing and capacity testing;
b) attack surface analysis to determine all avenues of ingress and egress to and from the
system, common vulnerabilities including but not limited to weak ACLs, exposed ports and
services running with elevated privileges;
c) black box known vulnerability scanning focused on detecting known vulnerabilities in the
product hardware, host or software components. For example, this could be a network
based known vulnerability scan;
d) for compiled software, software composition analysis on all binary executable files,
including embedded firmware, delivered by the supplier to be installed for a product. This
analysis shall detect the following types of problems at a minimum:
1) known vulnerabilities in the product software components;
2) linking to vulnerable libraries;
3) security rule violations; and
4) compiler settings that can lead to vulnerabilities;
e) dynamic runtime resource management testing that detects flaws not visible under static
code analysis, including but not limited to denial of service conditions due to failing to
release runtime handles, memory leaks and accesses made to shared memory without
authentication. This testing shall be applied if such tools are available.
```
#### 9.4.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Void.
```
### 9.5 SVV-4: Penetration testing

#### 9.5.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed to identify and characterize security-related issues via tests that
focus on discovering and exploiting security vulnerabilities in the product.
```
#### 9.5.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Penetration testing focuses specifically on compromising the confidentiality, integrity or
availability of the product. It can involve defeating multiple aspects of the defense in depth
design. For example, bypassing authentication to access the product, using elevation of
privilege to gain administrative access and then compromising confidentiality by breaking
encryption. As this example shows, penetration testing involves approaching testing like an
attacker and often involves exploiting chained vulnerabilities in a product.
```
## Española

## de

## Normalización,

## UNE






```

```

##### IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018 – 37 –

```
This process is required to ensure that efforts have been taken to discover security-related
issues in the product or product documentation that could allow the product to be exploited.
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier attempts to breach the security of the
product through penetration testing. Penetration testing consists of confirming that
vulnerabilities in any product capability or the defense in depth strategy can be exploited and
used to compromise security of the product. It requires in depth knowledge of the type of
product being tested along with security testing tools and techniques. Penetration testing can
involve the use of manual techniques, test tools or combinations of the two.
```
### 9.6 SVV-5: Independence of testers

#### 9.6.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed to ensure that individuals performing testing are independent
from the developers who designed and implemented the product according to Table 3.
```
## Table 3 – Required level of independence of testers from developers

```
Test type Reference Level of independence
Security requirements testing SVV-1 – Security requirements

```
```
Independent department

Attack surface analysis SVV-3 – Vulnerability testing Independent person
Known vulnerability scanning SVV-3 – Vulnerability testing Independent person
Software composition analysis SVV-3 – Vulnerability testing None

```
```
The levels of independence are defined as follows:
```
- **None** – no independence required. Developer can perform the testing.
- **Independent person** – the person who performs the testing cannot be one of the
    developers of the product.
- **Independent department** – the person who performs the testing cannot report to the
    same first line manager as any developers of the product. Alternatively, they could be a
    member of a quality assurance (QA) department.
- **Independent organization** – the person who performs the testing cannot be part of the
    same organization as any developers of the product. An organization can be a separate
    legal entity, a division of a company or a department of a company that reports to a
    different executive such as a vice president or similar level.

#### 9.6.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
An independent tester can often find out more, other and different defects than a tester
working within a programming team – or a tester who is by profession a programmer. Such a
tester brings a different set of assumptions to testing and to reviews, which often helps in
exposing the hidden defects and problems. In addition, an independent tester who reports to
senior management can report his results honestly and without any concern for reprisal that
might result from pointing out problems in co-workers’ or, worse yet, the manager’s work.

```

##### – 38 – IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018

```
Additional security defects can often be found when a tester’s black-box level knowledge of
the product is supplemented with white-box level knowledge of a developer acting as an
advisor to the tester.
```
## 10 Practice 6 – Management of security-related issues

### 10.1 Purpose

```
The processes specified by this practice are used for handling security-related issues of a
product that has been configured to employ its defense in depth strategy (see Clause 7)
within the product security context (see Clause 6).
```
### 10.2 DM-1: Receiving notifications of security-related issues

#### 10.2.1 Requirement

```
A process shall exist for receiving and tracking to closure security-related issues in the
product reported by internal and external sources including at a minimum:
```
```
a) security verification and validation testers;
b) suppliers of third-party components used in the product;
c) product developers and testers; and
d) product users including integrators, asset owners, and maintenance personnel.
```
```
NOTE External security verification and validation testers include researchers.
```
#### 10.2.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that security-related issues/defects discovered by any
organization within the product supplier or external organizations (for example, product users
and security researchers) can be reported to the product supplier and tracked to closure.
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier defined instructions for reporting
security-related issues (see ISO/IEC 30111 [23]) to it. For reports from external entities, the
product supplier will have incident response processes such as those identified in
ISO/IEC 29147 [22] for receiving vulnerability reports about supported products and
interacting with the entity that reported the issue.
```
```
Guidelines for reporting security-related issues are to be readily accessible to each of the
potential internal and external sources of these reports. Awareness training, product
documentation and support websites are all potential ways to communicate this information.
These guidelines include:
```
```
a) information needed to facilitate validation;
b) how to protect the confidentiality of and access to the information being reported;
c) the degree of communications with the entity that reported the security-related issue;
d) timelines for reporting internally discovered security-related issues in released products;
and
e) a strategy for handling third-party component vulnerabilities discovered internally.
```
### 10.3 DM-2: Reviewing security-related issues

#### 10.3.1 Requirement

```
A process shall exist for ensuring that reported security-related issues are investigated in a
timely manner to determine their:
```
```
a) applicability to the product;
```
## Española

## de

## Normalización,

## UNE






```

```

##### IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018 – 39 –

```
b) verifiability; and
c) threats that trigger the issue.
```
```
NOTE Timeliness is driven by market forces.
```
#### 10.3.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that security-related issues reported to the product supplier
are examined to determine that they are applicable to the product, are verifiable, and that the
cause of the issue (such as the threat(s)) is understood.
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier verifies all security issues reported to it.
Perceived security-related issues can be unsubstantiated or not applicable to the product, so
there needs to be a process to verify and examine reported vulnerabilities (see
ISO/IEC 30111).
```
```
For security-related issues in components maintained by the product developer, this process
can involve such activities as attempting to reproduce the reported vulnerability or examining
the third-party embedded source code’s usage within the product. For security-related issues
in components maintained by a third-party, this process can be as straightforward as
comparing the version of the third-party binary with the versions to which the patch applies.
```
### 10.4 DM-3: Assessing security-related issues

#### 10.4.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for analysing security-related issues in the product to include:
```
```
a) assessing their impact with respect to:
1) the actual security context in which they were discovered;
2) the product’s security context (see Clause 6); and
3) the product’s defense in depth strategy (see Clause 7);
b) severity as defined by a vulnerability scoring system (for example, CVSS);
c) identifying all other products/product versions containing the security-related issue (if any);
d) identifying the root causes of the issue; and
e) identifying related security issues.
```
```
For root cause analysis, a methodical approach such as that described in IEC 6 2740 [25] may
be employed.
```
#### 10.4.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that the potential impact of security-related design issues
is examined and understood to support decisions related to how they will be addressed.
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier assesses the potential impact and
severity of each security-related issue, determines whether the issues exist in other products
or versions (for example, by using the same or similar components) and identifies the root
causes of the issue. Completing such an assessment provides the basis for determining how
to address the issue (see 10.5), and which development life-cycle processes, such as
redesign activities and threat model updates, may be involved in the resolution.
```
```
NOTE Risk assessments can be used in this evaluation of security-related issues.
```
```
Verifiable security-related issues can vary widely in their security impact and their distribution
within the product, so there needs to be a process for characterizing each issue so that an
appropriate resolution can be determined.
```
## Española

## de

## Normalización,

## UNE






```

```

##### – 40 – IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018

```
It is recommended that the process identify conditions that would exit the security defect
management process such as duplicate, non-security, and third-party security-related issues
(see ISO/IEC 30111). The impact assessment should also take into consideration additional
factors such as the scope of affected product users, the potential for collateral damage, the
availability of exploits and (for control systems) the potential impact to essential functions
(see IEC 6 2443-3-3).
```
```
The impact assessment may be as simple as a qualitative rating (for example, low, medium
and high), a more quantitative method based on likelihood and consequence or a
standardized method such as the CVSS. A security-related issue that is associated with a
widely used design pattern or implementation method can be symptomatic of a larger problem.
In such a situation, the impact assessment associated with the vulnerability should address
the combined impact of all instances rather than dealing with each instance in isolation.
```
### 10.5 DM-4: Addressing security-related issues

#### 10.5.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for addressing security-related issues and determining whether
to report them based on the results of the impact assessment (see 10.4). The supplier shall
establish an acceptable level of residual risk that shall be applied when determining an
appropriate way to address each issue. Options include one or more of the following:
```
```
a) fixing the issue through one or more of the following:
1) defense in depth strategy or design change;
2) addition of one or more security requirements and/or capabilities;
3) use of compensating mechanisms; and/or
4) disabling or removing features;
b) creating a remediation plan to fix the problem;
c) deferring the problem for future resolution (reapply this requirement at some time in the
future) and specifying the reason(s) and associated risk(s);
d) not fixing the problem if the residual risk is below the established acceptable level of
residual risk.
```
```
In all cases, the following shall be done as well:
```
```
a) inform other processes of the issue or related issue(s), including processes for other
products/product revisions; and
b) i nform third parties if problems found in included third-party source code.
```
```
When security-related issues are resolved recommendations to prevent similar errors from
occurring in the future shall be evaluated.
```
```
This process shall include a periodic review of open security-related issues to ensure that
issues are being addressed appropriately. This periodic review shall at a minimum occur
during each release or iteration cycle.
```
```
NOTE When the resolution decision is to fix the security-related issue in the product implementation, the timing of
the release of the fix can result in a patch (see Clause 12 ) or the fix can be deferred until the next release.
```
#### 10.5.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that a determination is made for how to handle (address)
each security-related issue and that no security-related issue is inadvertently overlooked or
ignored.
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier reviews the potential residual risk of
each security-related issue and makes a justifiable decision for how to handle (address) it.
```
## Española

## de

## Normalización,

## UNE






```

```

##### IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018 – 41 –

```
Residual risk can be determined using many different methods. An example would be to start
with CVSS score, but then add other security controls and countermeasures not accounted for
in CVSS such as whether the issue is applicable to the product’s security context.
```
```
The process for deciding upon and implementing a resolution to a security-related issue
needs to address these considerations (see ISO/IEC 30111) because of their potential impact:
```
```
a) a proposed resolution can violate a premise of the secure design that other aspects of the
product rely upon;
b) a proposed resolution can be unnecessary because of a mismatch between the reporting
entity’s security context and the product security context;
c) a proposed resolution can only partially reduce the impact of the security-related issue,
may take an unacceptably long time to implement because of its complexity, or may be so
unusable that it is likely to be disabled; and
d) a proposed resolution can introduce side-effects that are unacceptable.
```
```
Timeliness for determining and implementing a resolution based on the impact of the security-
related issue will typically align with market forces and may drive establishment of clear
interfaces to related organizational processes (for example, legal, customer service and
public relations) to avoid unnecessary delays.
```
### 10.6 DM-5: Disclosing security-related issues

#### 10.6.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for informing product users about reportable security-related
issues (see 10.5) in supported products in a timely manner with content that includes but is
not limited to the following information:
```
```
a) issue description, vulnerability score as per CVSS or a similar system for ranking
vulnerabilities, and affected product version(s); and
b) description of the resolution.
```
```
NOTE 1 The description of the resolution can include references to installation of patches (see Clause 12 ).
```
```
NOTE 2 Timeliness is driven by market forces.
```
```
The strategy for handling third-party component vulnerabilities discovered by the product
developer should take into account the possibility of premature public disclosure by the third-
party component supplier.
```
#### 10.6.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that product users are informed of resolved security-related
issues that have been designated as reportable. Reportable resolutions are typically those
that are related to released products and whose issue severity is deemed high enough to
report by the product supplier. Product users need this information to make informed security
assessments about their operations, and service providers use this information to handle
vulnerabilities as part of their event management capability (see IEC 6 2443-2-4).
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier has procedures for determining which
security issues are reportable, and reporting resolutions for reportable issues to the users of
the product. The disclosure process will typically include provisions for informational alerts in
addition to vulnerability notices. For example, informational alerts can be used to notify
product users of compensating mechanisms in response to current cyber security activity or to
inform product users that the product is not susceptible to a highly publicized vulnerability.
See IEC 29147 [22] for information regarding content of notifications.

### 10.7 DM-6: Periodic review of security defect management practice

#### 10.7.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for conducting periodic reviews of the security-related issue
management process. Periodic reviews of the process shall, at a minimum, examine
security-related issues managed through the process since the last periodic review to
determine if the management process was complete, efficient, and led to the resolution of
each security-related issue. Periodic reviews of the security-related issue management
process shall be conducted at least annually.
```
#### 10.7.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required for continuous improvement of the issue management practice.
```
## 11 Practice 7 – Security update management

### 11.1 Purpose

```
The processes specified by this practice are used to ensure that security updates associated
with the product are tested for regressions and made available to product users in a timely
manner.
```
### 11.2 SUM-1: Security update qualification

#### 11.2.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed for verifying that
```
```
1) security updates created by the product developer address the intended security
vulnerabilities;
2) security updates do not introduce regressions, including but not limited to patches created
by:
a) the product developer;
b) suppliers of components used in the product; and
c) suppliers of components or platforms on which the product depends.
```
```
The process should include a confirmation that update is not contradicting other operational,
safety or legal constraints.
```
#### 11.2.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that patches applicable to the product are evaluated to
ensure that they do not adversely affect operation of the product.
```
```
Having this process means that qualification of patches (typically via testing) is performed to
verify that patches applicable to the product do not directly or indirectly (for example, via side
effects) compromise the product’s operation or defense in depth strategy (see Clause 7).
Documentation about this process may be used by the service provider to address the patch
management requirements of IEC 6 2443-2-4.
```
### 11.3 SUM-2: Security update documentation

#### 11.3.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed to ensure that documentation about product security updates is
made available to product users that includes but is not limited to:
```
```
a) the product version number(s) to which the security patch applies;
```
## Española

## de

## Normalización,

## UNE






```

```

##### IEC 62443-4-1:2018 © IEC 2018 – 43 –

```
b) instructions on how to apply approved patches manually and via an automated process;
c) description of any impacts that applying the patch to the product can have, including
reboot;
d) instructions on how to verify that an approved patch has been applied; and
e) risks of not applying the patch and mediations that can be used for patches that are not
approved or deployed by the asset owner.
```
#### 11.3.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This process is required to ensure that security patches are documented to allow approved
patches to be installed and non-approved patches to be remediated.
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier provides or otherwise makes
documentation available that identifies and describes applicable security patches, how to
install approved patches, how to determine patch status (whether a patch has been applied)
of components and how to mediate non-approved patches. See the patch management
requirements of IE C 62443-2-4 for more information.
```
```
11.4 SUM-3: Dependent component or operating system s ecurity update
documentation
```
#### 11.4.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed to ensure that documentation about dependent component or
operating system security updates is made available to product users that includes but is not
limited to:
```
```
a) stating whether the product is compatible with the dependent component or operating
system security update; and
b) for security updates that are unapproved by the product vendor, the mitigations that can
be used in lieu of not applying the update.
```
#### 11.4.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
End users are hesitant to install software in an IACS that might upset operations. As a result,
vendors need to provide information to the users about whether a particular security update of
the operating system is compatible with the product.
```
### 11.5 SUM-4: Security update delivery

#### 11.5.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed to ensure that security updates for all supported products and
product versions are made available to product users in a manner that facilitates verification
that the security patch is authentic.
```
```
11.5.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance
```
```
This process is required to ensure that product users can obtain applicable security patches
for the product in a timely manner and to reduce the possibility that the security patches are
fraudulent (see Clause 11 ).
```
```
Having this process means that the product supplier provides a mechanism or technique that
allows product users to verify the authenticity of patches. Concurrent release of patches for all
supported versions can reduce the time window between awareness of the vulnerability and
the availability of patches.

### 11.6 SUM-5: Timely delivery of security patches

#### 11.6.1 Requirement

```
A process shall be employed to define a policy that specifies the timeframes for delivering and
qualifying (see 11.2) security updates to product users and to ensure that this policy is
followed. At a minimum, this policy shall consider the following factors:
```
```
a) the potential impact of the vulnerability;
b) public knowledge of the vulnerability;
c) whether published exploits exist for the vulnerability;
d) the volume of deployed products that are affected; and
e) the availability of an effective mitigation in lieu of the patch.
```
#### 11.6.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Security updates typically have target release timing which is based on the factors listed in
this requirement. For example, some companies classify patches as required to be addressed
within 30 days, 60 days or 90 days or longer of being found.
```
## 12 Practice 8 – Security guidelines

### 12.1 Purpose

```
The processes specified by this practice are used to provide user documentation that
describes how to integrate, configure, and maintain the defense in depth strategy of the

a) policies and procedures associated with the product security context, as defined in
Clause 6;
b) architectural considerations, such as firewall placement and use of compensating
mechanisms including security measures, as defined in Clause 7;
c) configuring security settings/options, such as configuring firewall rules, delegation,
certificate management, and managing user accounts (for example, setting their
privileges/permissions); and
d) use of tools to assist in the hardening.
```
```
NOTE Patching is not included in this list, but is addressed in Clause 11.
```
```

## Annex A (informative) Possible metrics

```
Subclause 5.15 requires that the development organization takes steps to continuously
improve its process. Using metrics that show the effectiveness of the development process is
helpful to determine if measurable improvements are being made. The specific metrics to be
collected (if any) are up to the product developer and may vary significantly, but some
examples are included in this Annex A.
```
```
As an example, the baseline security posture score (SPS) can be calculated as follows:
```
```
NOTE 1 The actual method used by the vendor can vary. Using a scale of 0-100 with 100 being the worst,
multiple factors are averaged together to determine the score.
a) Functional security – Based on security functions defined in IEC 6 2443-4-2
```
```
EXAMPLE 1 NSF – NRM normalized to 100
where
NSF is the number of security functions defined in IEC 6 2443-4-2;
NRM is the number of such requirements met.
b) Implementation security –
1) based on the results of SCA
