### Impact Assessments

Impact Assessments generally accompany all UK Government interventions of a regulatory nature that affect the private sector, civil society organisations and public services. They apply regardless of whether the regulation originates from a domestic or international source and can accompany primary (Acts etc) and secondary legislation (SIs). An Impact Assessment allows those with an interest in the policy area to understand:

* Why the government is proposing to intervene;
* The main options the government is considering, and which one is preferred;
* How and to what extent new policies may impact on them; and,
* The estimated costs and benefits of proposed measures.
