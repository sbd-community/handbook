Coordinated assessment procedure for performance studies

1.

By means of the electronic system referred to in Article 69, the sponsor of a performance study to be conducted in more than one Member State may submit, for the purpose of Article 66, a single application that, upon receipt, is transmitted electronically to all Member States in which the performance study is to be conducted.

2.

The sponsor shall propose in the single application referred to in paragraph 1 that one of the Member States in which the performance study is to be conducted acts as coordinating Member State. The Member States in which the performance study is to be conducted shall, within six days of submission of the application, agree on one of them taking the role of the coordinating Member State. If they do not agree on a coordinating Member State, the coordinating Member State proposed by the sponsor shall assume that role.

3.

Under the direction of the coordinating Member State referred to in paragraph 2, the Member States concerned shall coordinate their assessment of the application, in particular of the documentation referred to in Chapter I of Annex XIV.

However, the completeness of the documentation referred to in Sections 1.13, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of Chapter I of Annex XIV and point (c) of Section 2.3.2. of Part A of Annex XIII shall be assessed separately by each Member State concerned in accordance with Article 66(1) to (5).

4.

With regard to documentation other than that referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 3, the coordinating Member State shall:

(a)

within six days of receipt of the single application, notify the sponsor that it is the coordinating Member State (‘notification date’);

(b)

for the purpose of the validation of the application, take into account any considerations submitted within seven days of the notification date by any Member State concerned;

(c)

within 10 days of the notification date, assess whether the performance study falls within the scope of this Regulation and whether the application is complete and shall notify the sponsor accordingly. Article 66(1) and (3) to (5) shall apply to the coordinating Member State in relation to that assessment;

(d)

establish the results of its assessment in a draft assessment report to be transmitted within 26 days of the validation date to the Member States concerned. By day 38 after the validation date, the other Member States concerned shall transmit their comments and proposals on the draft assessment report and the underlying application to the coordinating Member State which shall take due account of those comments and proposals in its finalisation of the final assessment report, to be transmitted within 45 days of the validation date to the sponsor and the other Member States concerned.

The final assessment report shall be taken into account by all Member States concerned when deciding on the sponsor's application in accordance with Article 66(7).

5.

As regards the assessment of the documentation referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 3, each Member State concerned may request, on a single occasion, additional information from the sponsor. The sponsor shall submit the requested additional information within the period set by the Member State concerned, which shall not exceed 12 days from the receipt of the request. The expiry of the last deadline pursuant to point (d) of paragraph 4 shall be suspended from the date of the request until such time as the additional information has been received.

6.

For class C and D devices, the coordinating Member State may also extend the periods referred to in paragraph 4 by a further 50 days, for the purpose of consulting with experts.

7.

The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, further specify the procedures and timescales for coordinated assessments to be taken into account by Member States concerned when deciding on the sponsor's application. Such implementing acts may also set out the procedures and timescales for coordinated assessment in the case of substantial modifications pursuant to paragraph 12 of this Article and in the case of reporting of adverse events pursuant to Article 76(4) and in the case of performance studies involving companion diagnostics, where the medicinal products are under a concurrent coordinated assessment of a clinical trial under Regulation (EU) No 536/2014. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 107(3).

8.

Where the conclusion of the coordinating Member State concerning the area of coordinated assessment is that the conduct of the performance study is acceptable or acceptable subject to compliance with specific conditions, that conclusion shall be deemed to be the conclusion of all Member State(s) concerned.

Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, a Member State concerned may only disagree with the conclusion of the coordinating Member State concerning the area of coordinated assessment on the following grounds:

(a)

when it considers that participation in the performance study would lead to a subject receiving treatment inferior to that received in normal clinical practice in that Member State concerned;

(b)

infringement of national law; or

(c)

considerations as regards subject safety and data reliability and robustness submitted under point (d) of paragraph 4.

Where one of the Member States concerned disagrees with the conclusion on the basis of the second subparagraph of this paragraph, it shall communicate its disagreement, together with a detailed justification, through the electronic system referred to in Article 69 to the Commission, to all other Member States concerned, and to the sponsor.

9.

Where the conclusion of the coordinating Member State concerning the area of coordinated assessment is that the performance study is not acceptable, that conclusion shall be deemed to be the conclusion of all Member States concerned.

10.

A Member State concerned shall refuse to authorise a performance study if it disagrees with the conclusion of the coordinating Member State as regards any of the grounds referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 8, or if it finds, on duly justified grounds, that the aspects addressed in Sections 1.13, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of Chapter I of Annex XIV are not complied with, or where an ethics committee has issued a negative opinion in relation to that performance study which is valid in accordance with national law for that entire Member State. That Member State shall provide for an appeal procedure in respect of such refusal.

11.

Each Member State concerned shall notify the sponsor through the electronic system referred to in Article 69 as to whether the performance study is authorised, whether it is authorised subject to conditions, or whether authorisation has been refused. Notification shall be done by way of one single decision within five days of the transmission, pursuant to point (d) of paragraph 4 of this Article, by the coordinating Member State of the final assessment report. Where an authorisation of a performance study is subject to conditions, those conditions may only be such that, by their nature, they cannot be fulfilled at the time of that authorisation.

12.

Any substantial modifications as referred to in Article 71 shall be notified to the Member States concerned by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 69. Any assessment as to whether there are grounds for disagreement as referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 8 of this Article shall be carried out under the direction of the coordinating Member State, except for substantial modifications concerning sections 1.13, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of Chapter I of Annex XIV and point (c) of Section 2.3.2 of Part A of Annex XIII, which shall be assessed separately by each Member State concerned.

13.

The Commission shall provide administrative support to the coordinating Member State in the accomplishment of its tasks under this Chapter.

Where the manufacturer of the device concerned considers that the incident is not a serious incident or is to be treated as an increase in expected erroneous results, which will be covered by trend reporting in accordance with to Article 83, it shall provide an explanatory statement. If the competent authority does not agree with the conclusion of the explanatory statement, it may require the manufacturer to provide a report in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 5 of this Article and require it to ensure that appropriate follow-up action is taken in accordance with Article 84.

Article 83

Trend reporting

1.

Manufacturers shall report by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 87 any statistically significant increase in the frequency or severity of incidents that are not serious incidents that could have a significant impact on the benefit-risk analysis
[►C2](./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=celex:32017R0746R%2803%29 "32017R0746R(03): REPLACED")
 referred to in Sections 1 and 8 of Annex I and which ◄  have led or may lead to unacceptable risks to the health or safety of patients, users or other persons or of any significant increase in expected erroneous results established in comparison to the stated performance of the device as referred to in points (a) and (b) of Section 9.1 of Annex I and specified in the technical documentation and product information.

The manufacturer shall specify how to manage the incidents referred to in the first subparagraph and the methodology used for determining any statistically significant increase in the frequency or severity of such events or change in performance, as well as the observation period, in the post-market surveillance plan referred to in Article 79.

2.

The competent authorities may conduct their own assessments on the trend reports referred to in paragraph 1 and require the manufacturer to adopt appropriate measures in accordance with this Regulation in order to ensure the protection of public health and patient safety. Each competent authority shall inform the Commission, the other competent authorities and the notified body that issued the certificate, of the results of such assessment and of the adoption of such measures.

Article 84

Analysis of serious incidents and field safety corrective actions

1.

Following the reporting of a serious incident pursuant to Article 82(1), the manufacturer shall, without delay, perform the necessary investigations in relation to the serious incident and the devices concerned. This shall include risk assessment of the incident and field safety corrective action taking into account the criteria as referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article as appropriate.

The manufacturer shall co-operate with the competent authorities and where relevant with the notified body concerned during the investigations referred to in the first subparagraph and shall not perform any investigation which involves altering the device or a sample of the batch concerned in a way which may affect any subsequent evaluation of the causes of the incident, prior to informing the competent authorities of such action.

2.

Member States shall take the necessary steps to ensure that any information regarding a serious incident that has occurred within their territory, or a field safety corrective action that has been or is to be undertaken within their territory, and that is brought to their knowledge in accordance with Article 82 is evaluated centrally at national level by their competent authority, if possible together with the manufacturer, and, where relevant, the notified body concerned.

3.

In the context of the evaluation referred to in paragraph 2, the competent authority shall evaluate the risks arising from the reported serious incident and evaluate any field safety corrective actions, taking into account the protection of public health and criteria such as causality, detectability and probability of recurrence of the problem, frequency of use of the device, probability of occurrence of direct or indirect harm, the severity of that harm, the clinical benefit of the device, intended and potential users, and the population affected. The competent authority shall also evaluate the adequacy of the field safety corrective action envisaged or undertaken by the manufacturer and the need for, and kind of, any other corrective action, in particular taking into account the principle of inherent safety contained in Annex I.

Upon request by the national competent authority, manufacturers shall provide for all documents necessary for the risk assessment.

4.

The competent authority shall monitor the manufacturer's investigation of a serious incident. Where necessary, a competent authority may intervene in a manufacturer's investigation or initiate an independent investigation.

5.

The manufacturer shall provide a final report to the competent authority setting out its findings from the investigation by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 87. The report shall set out conclusions and where relevant indicate corrective actions to be taken.

6.

In the case of companion diagnostic, the evaluating competent authority or the coordinating competent authority referred to in paragraph 9 of this Article shall, depending on whether the relevant competent authority of the Member State that authorised the medicinal products or the EMA was consulted by the notified body in accordance with the procedures set out in Section 5.2 of Annex IX and Section 3.11 of Annex X, inform that national competent authority or the EMA, as appropriate.

7.

After carrying out the evaluation in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, the evaluating competent authority shall, through the electronic system referred to in Article 87, inform without delay the other competent authorities of the corrective action taken or envisaged by the manufacturer or required of it to minimise the risk of recurrence of the serious incident, including information on the underlying serious incidents and the outcome of its assessment.

8.

The manufacturer shall ensure that information about the field safety corrective action taken is brought without delay to the attention of users of the device in question by means of a field safety notice.

ANNEX I

GENERAL SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

CHAPTER I

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

| 1. | Devices shall achieve the performance intended by their manufacturer and shall be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, they are suitable for their intended purpose. They shall be safe and effective and shall not compromise the clinical condition or the safety of patients, or the safety and health of users or, where applicable, other persons, provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art. |

| 2. | The requirement in this Annex to reduce risks as far as possible means the reduction of risks as far as possible without adversely affecting the benefit-risk ratio. |

| 3. | Manufacturers shall establish, implement, document and maintain a risk management system.  Risk management shall be understood as a continuous iterative process throughout the entire lifecycle of a device, requiring regular systematic updating. In carrying out risk management manufacturers shall:  (a)  establish and document a risk management plan for each device;  (b)  identify and analyse the known and foreseeable hazards associated with each device;  (c)  estimate and evaluate the risks associated with, and occurring during, the intended use and during reasonably foreseeable misuse;  (d)  eliminate or control the risks referred to in point (c) in accordance with the requirements of Section 4;  (e)  evaluate the impact of information from the production phase and, in particular, from the post-market surveillance system, on hazards and the frequency of occurrence thereof, on estimates of their associated risks, as well as on the overall risk, the benefit-risk ratio and risk acceptability; and  (f)  based on the evaluation of the impact of the information referred to in point (e), if necessary amend control measures in line with the requirements of Section 4. |

| 4. | Risk control measures adopted by manufacturers for the design and manufacture of the devices shall conform to safety principles, taking account of the generally acknowledged state of the art. To reduce risks, the manufacturers shall manage risks so that the residual risk associated with each hazard as well as the overall residual risk is judged acceptable. In selecting the most appropriate solutions, manufacturers shall, in the following order of priority:  (a)  eliminate or reduce risks as far as possible through safe design and manufacture;  (b)  where appropriate, take adequate protection measures, including alarms if necessary, in relation to risks that cannot be eliminated; and  (c)  provide information for safety (warnings/precautions/contra-indications) and, where appropriate, training to users.  Manufacturers shall inform users of any residual risks. |

| 5. | In eliminating or reducing risks related to use error, the manufacturer shall:  (a)  reduce as far as possible the risks related to the ergonomic features of the device and the environment in which the device is intended to be used (design for patient safety), and  (b)  give consideration to the technical knowledge, experience, education, training and use environment, where applicable, and the medical and physical conditions of intended users (design for lay, professional, disabled or other users). |

| 6. | The characteristics and performance of a device shall not be adversely affected to such a degree that the health or safety of the patient or the user and, where applicable, of other persons are compromised during the lifetime of the device, as indicated by the manufacturer, when the device is subjected to the stresses which can occur during normal conditions of use and has been properly maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. |

| 7. | Devices shall be designed, manufactured and packaged in such a way that their characteristics and performance during their intended use are not adversely affected during transport and storage, for example, through fluctuations of temperature and humidity, taking account of the instructions and information provided by the manufacturer. |

| 8. | All known and foreseeable risks, and any undesirable effects shall be minimised and be acceptable when weighed against the evaluated potential benefits to the patients and/or the user arising from the intended performance of the device during normal conditions of use. |

CHAPTER II

REQUIREMENTS REGARDING PERFORMANCE, DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE

9.   Performance characteristics

| 9.1. | Devices shall be designed and manufactured in such a way that they are suitable for the purposes referred to in point (2) of Article 2, as specified by the manufacturer, and suitable with regard to the performance they are intended to achieve, taking account of the generally acknowledged state of the art. They shall achieve the performances, as stated by the manufacturer and in particular, where applicable:  (a)  the analytical performance, such as, analytical sensitivity, analytical specificity, trueness (bias), precision (repeatability and reproducibility), accuracy (resulting from trueness and precision), limits of detection and quantitation, measuring range, linearity, cut-off, including determination of appropriate criteria for specimen collection and handling and control of known relevant endogenous and exogenous interference, cross-reactions; and  (b)  the clinical performance, such as diagnostic sensitivity, diagnostic specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratio, expected values in normal and affected populations. |

| 9.2. | The performance characteristics of the device shall be maintained during the lifetime of the device as indicated by the manufacturer. |

| 9.3. | Where the performance of devices depends on the use of calibrators and/or control materials, the metrological traceability of values assigned to calibrators and/or control materials shall be assured through suitable reference measurement procedures and/or suitable reference materials of a higher metrological order. Where available, metrological traceability of values assigned to calibrators and control materials shall be assured to certified reference materials or reference measurement procedures. |

| 9.4. | The characteristics and performances of the device shall be specifically checked in the event that they may be affected when the device is used for the intended use under normal conditions:  (a)  for devices for self-testing, performances obtained by laypersons;  (b)  for devices for near-patient testing, performances obtained in relevant environments (for example, patient home, emergency units, ambulances). |

PART C

THE UDI SYSTEM

1.   Definitions

Automatic identification and data capture (‘AIDC’)

AIDC is a technology used to automatically capture data. AIDC technologies include bar codes, smart cards, biometrics and RFID.

Basic UDI-DI

The Basic UDI-DI is the primary identifier of a device model. It is the DI assigned at the level of the device unit of use. It is the main key for records in the UDI database and is referenced in relevant certificates and EU declarations of conformity.

Unit of Use DI

The Unit of Use DI serves to associate the use of a device with a patient in instances in which a UDI is not labelled on the individual device at the level of its unit of use, for example in the event of several units of the same device being packaged together.

Configurable device

A configurable device is a device that consists of several components which can be assembled by the manufacturer in multiple configurations. Those individual components may be devices in themselves.

Configuration

Configuration is a combination of items of equipment, as specified by the manufacturer, that operate together as a device to achieve an intended purpose. The combination of items may be modified, adjusted or customised to meet specific needs.

UDI-DI

The UDI-DI is a unique numeric or alphanumeric code specific to a model of device and that is also used as the ‘access key’ to information stored in a UDI database.

Human Readable Interpretation (HRI)

HRI is a legible interpretation of the data characters encoded in the UDI carrier.

Packaging levels

Packaging levels means the various levels of device packaging that contain a fixed quantity of devices, such as a carton or case.

Production Identifier (UDI-PI)

The UDI-PI is a numeric or alphanumeric code that identifies the unit of device production.

The different types of UDI-PI(s) include serial number, lot number, software identification and manufacturing or expiry date or both types of date.

Radio Frequency Identification (‘RFID’)

RFID is a technology that uses communication through the use of radio waves to exchange data between a reader and an electronic tag attached to an object, for the purpose of identification.

Shipping containers

A shipping container is a container in relation to which traceability is controlled by a process specific to logistics systems.

Unique Device Identifier (‘UDI’)

The UDI is a series of numeric or alphanumeric characters that is created through a globally accepted device identification and coding standard. It allows the unambiguous identification of a specific device on the market. The UDI is comprised of the UDI-DI and the UDI-PI.

The word ‘Unique’ does not imply serialisation of individual production units.

UDI carrier

The UDI carrier is the means of conveying the UDI by using AIDC and, if applicable, its HRI.

UDI carriers include, inter alia, ID/linear bar code, 2D/Matrix bar code, RFID.

2.   General requirements

| 2.1. | The affixing of the UDI is an additional requirement — it does not replace any other marking or labelling requirements laid down in Annex I to this Regulation. |

| 2.2. | The manufacturer shall assign and maintain unique UDIs for its devices. |

| 2.3. | Only the manufacturer may place the UDI on the device or its packaging. |

| 2.4. | Only coding standards provided by issuing entities designated by the Commission pursuant to Article 24(2) may be used. |

3.   The UDI

| 3.1. | A UDI shall be assigned to the device itself or its packaging. Higher levels of packaging shall have their own UDI. |

| 3.2. | Shipping containers shall be exempted from the requirement in Section 3.1. By way of example, a UDI shall not be required on a logistics unit; where a healthcare provider orders multiple devices using the UDI or model number of individual devices and the manufacturer places those devices in a container for shipping or to protect the individually packaged devices, the container (logistics unit) shall not be subject to UDI requirements. |

| 3.3. | The UDI shall contain two parts: a UDI-DI and a UDI-PI. |

| 3.4. | The UDI-DI shall be unique at each level of device packaging. |

| 3.5. | If a lot number, serial number, software identification or expiry date appears on the label, it shall be part of the UDI-PI. If there is also a manufacturing date on the label, it does not need to be included in the UDI-PI. If there is only a manufacturing date on the label, this shall be used as the UDI-PI. |

| 3.6. | Each component that is considered to be a device and is commercially available on its own shall be assigned a separate UDI unless the components are part of a configurable device that is marked with its own UDI. |

| 3.7. | Kits shall be assigned and bear their own UDI. |

| 3.8. | The manufacturer shall assign the UDI to a device following the relevant coding standard. |

| 3.9. | A new UDI-DI shall be required whenever there is a change that could lead to misidentification of the device and/or ambiguity in its traceability. In particular, any change of one of the following UDI database data elements shall require a new UDI-DI:  (a)  Name or trade name,  (b)  device version or model,  (c)  labelled as single use,  (d)  packaged sterile,  (e)  need for sterilization before use,  (f)  quantity of devices provided in a package,  (g)  critical warnings or contra-indications. |

| 3.10. | Manufacturers that repackage or relabel devices with their own label shall retain a record of the original device manufacturer's UDI. |

4.   UDI carrier

| 4.1. | The UDI carrier (AIDC and HRI representation of the UDI) shall be placed on the label and on all higher levels of device packaging. Higher levels do not include shipping containers. |

| 4.2. | In the event of there being significant space constraints on the unit of use packaging the UDI carrier may be placed on the next higher packaging level. |

| 4.3. | For single use class A and class B devices packaged and labelled individually, the UDI carrier shall not be required to appear on the packaging but it shall appear on a higher level of packaging e.g. a carton containing several packages. However, when the healthcare provider is not expected to have access, in cases such as in home healthcare settings, to the higher level of device packaging, the UDI shall be placed on the packaging. |

| 4.4. | For devices exclusively intended for retail point of sale, the UDI-PIs in AIDC shall not be required to appear on the point of sale packaging. |

| 4.5. | When AIDC carriers other than the UDI carrier are part of the product labelling, the UDI carrier shall be readily identifiable. |

| 4.6. | If linear bar codes are used, the UDI-DI and UDI-PI may be concatenated or non-concatenated in two or more bar codes. All parts and elements of the linear bar code shall be distinguishable and identifiable. |

| 4.7. | If there are significant constraints limiting the use of both AIDC and HRI on the label, only the AIDC format shall be required to appear on the label. For devices intended to be used outside healthcare facilities, such as devices for home care, the HRI shall however appear on the label even if this results in there being no space for the AIDC. |

| 4.8. | The HRI format shall follow the rules of the UDI code-issuing entity. |

| 4.9. | If the manufacturer is using RFID technology, a linear or 2D bar code in line with the standard provided by the issuing entities shall also be provided on the label. |

| 4.10. | Devices that are reusable shall bear a UDI carrier on the device itself. The UDI carrier for reusable devices that require disinfection, sterilisation or refurbishing between patient uses shall be permanent and readable after each process performed to make the device ready for the subsequent use throughout the intended lifetime of the device. |

| 4.11. | The UDI carrier shall be readable during normal use and throughout the intended lifetime of the device. |

| 4.12. | If the UDI carrier is readily readable or scannable through the device's packaging, the placing of the UDI carrier on the packaging shall not be required. |

| 4.13. | In the case of single finished devices made up of multiple parts that must be assembled before first use, it shall be sufficient to place the UDI carrier on only one part of each device. |

| 4.14. | The UDI carrier shall be placed in a manner such that the AIDC can be accessed during normal operation or storage. |

| 4.15. | Bar code carriers that include both a UDI-DI and a UDI-PI may also include essential data for the device to operate or other data. |

5.   General principles of the UDI database

| 5.1. | The UDI database shall support the use of all core UDI database data elements referred to in Part B of this Annex. |

| 5.2. | Manufacturers shall be responsible for the initial submission and updates of the identifying information and other device data elements in the UDI database. |

| 5.3. | Appropriate methods/procedures for validation of the data provided shall be implemented. |

| 5.4. | Manufacturers shall periodically verify the correctness of all of the data relevant to devices they have placed on the market, except for devices that are no longer available on the market. |

| 5.5. | The presence of the device UDI-DI in the UDI database shall not be assumed to mean that the device is in conformity with this Regulation. |

| 5.6. | The database shall allow for the linking of all the packaging levels of the device. |

| 5.7. | The data for new UDI-DIs shall be available at the time the device is placed on the market. |

| 5.8. | Manufacturers shall update the relevant UDI database record within 30 days of a change being made to an element, which does not require a new UDI-DI. |

| 5.9. | Internationally accepted standards for data submission and updates shall, wherever possible, be used by the UDI database. |

| 5.10. | The user interface of the UDI database shall be available in all official languages of the Union. The use of free-text fields shall, however, be minimised in order to reduce translations. |

| 5.11. | Data relating to devices that are no longer available on the market shall be retained in the UDI database. |

6.   Rules for specific device types

6.1.   Reusable devices that are part of kits and that require cleaning, disinfection, sterilisation or refurbishing between uses

| 6.1.1. | The UDI of such devices shall be placed on the device and shall be readable after each procedure to make the device ready for the next use; |
