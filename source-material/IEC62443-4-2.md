## INTRODUCTION

### 0.1 Overview

```
Industrial automation and control system (IACS) organizations increasingly use commercial-
off-the-shelf (COTS) networked devices that are inexpensive, efficient and highly automated.
Control systems are also increasingly interconnected with non-IACS networks for valid
business reasons. These devices, open networking technologies and increased connectivity
provide an increased opportunity for cyber-attack against control system hardware and
software. That weakness may lead to health, safety and environmental (HSE), financial and/or
reputational consequences in deployed control systems.
```
```
Organizations choosing to deploy business information technology (IT) cyber security
solutions to address IACS security may not fully comprehend the results of their decision.
While many business IT applications and security solutions can be applied to IACS, they
should be applied in an appropriate way to eliminate inadvertent consequences. For this
reason, the approach used to define system requirements is based on a combination of
functional requirements and risk assessment, often including an awareness of operational
issues as well.
```
```
IACS security countermeasures should not have the potential to cause loss of essential
services and functions, including emergency procedures (IT security countermeasures, as
often deployed, do have this potential). IACS security goals focus on control system
availability, plant protection, plant operations (even in a degraded mode) and time-critical
system response. IT security goals often do not place the same emphasis on these factors;
they may be more concerned with protecting information rather than physical assets. These
different goals should be clearly stated as security objectives regardless of the degree of
plant integration achieved. A key step in the risk assessment, as required by IEC 6 2443‑ 2 ‑ 11
[1]^2 , should be the identification of which services and functions are truly essential for
operations (for example, in some facilities engineering support may be determined to be a
non-essential service or function). In some cases, it may be acceptable for a security action to
cause temporary loss of a non-essential service or function, unlike an essential service or
function that should not be adversely affected.
```
```
This document provides the cyber security technical requirements for the components that
make up an IACS, specifically the embedded devices, network components, host components
and software applications. Annex A describes categories of devices commonly used in IACSs.
This document derives its requirements from the IACS system security requirements
described in IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3. The intent of this document is to specify security capabilities that
enable a component to mitigate threats for a given security level (SL) without the assistance
of compensating countermeasures. Annex B provides a table that summarizes the SLs of
each of the requirements and requirement enhancements defined in this document.
```
```
The primary goal of the IEC 6 2443 series is to provide a flexible framework that facilitates
addressing current and future vulnerabilities in IACS and applying necessary mitigations in a
systematic, defensible manner. It is important to understand that the intention of the
IEC 6 2443 series is to build extensions to enterprise security that adapt the requirements for
business IT systems and combines them with the unique requirements for strong integrity and
availability needed by IACS.

### 0.2 Purpose and intended audience

```
The IACS community audience for this document is intended to be asset owners, system
integrators, product suppliers, and, where appropriate, compliance authorities. Compliance
authorities include government agencies and regulators with the legal authority to perform
audits to verify compliance with governing laws and regulations.
```
```
System integrators will use this document to assist them in procuring control system
components that make up an IACS solution. The assistance will be in the form of helping
system integrators specify the appropriate security capability level of the individual
components they require. The primary standards for system integrators are IEC 6 2443‑ 2 ‑ 1
[1], IEC 6 2443‑ 2 ‑4 [3], IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑2 [5]^3 and IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3 that provide organizational
and operational requirements for a security management system and guide them through the
process of defining security zones for a system and the target security capability levels ( SL-T)
for those zones. Once the SL-T for each zone has been defined, components that provide the
necessary security capabilities can be used to achieve the SL-T for each zone.
```
```
Product suppliers will use this document to understand the requirements placed on control
system components for specific security capability levels (SL-C) of those components. A
component may not provide a required capability itself but may be designed to integrate with
a higher-level entity and thus benefit from that entity’s capability – for example an embedded
device may not be maintaining a user directory itself, but may integrate with a system wide
authentication and authorization service and thus still meet the requirements to provide
individual user authentication, authorization and management capabilities. This document will
guide product suppliers as to which requirements can be allocated and which requirements
should be native in the components. As defined in Practice 8 of IEC 6 2443‑ 4 ‑1, the product
supplier will provide documentation on how to properly integrate the component into a system
to meet a specific SL-T.
```
```
The component requirements (CRs) in this document are derived from the system
requirements (SRs) in IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3. The requirements in IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3 are referred to as
SRs, which are derived from the overall foundational requirements (FRs) defined in
IEC 6 2443‑ 1 ‑1. CRs may also include a set of requirement enhancements (REs). The
combination of CRs and REs is what will determine the target security level that a component
is capable of.
```
```
This document provides component requirements for four types of components: software
application, embedded device, host device a nd network device. Thus, the CRs for each type
of component will be designated as follows:
```
- Software application requirements (SAR);
- Embedded device requirements (EDR);
- Host device requirements (HDR); and
- Network device requirements (NDR).

```
The majority of the requirements in this document are the same for the four types of
components and are thus designated simply as a CR. When there are unique component-
specific requirements then the generic requirement will state that the requirements are
component-specific and are located in the component-specific requirements clauses of this
document.

## SECURITY FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION AND CONTROL SYSTEMS –

## Part 4-2: Technical security requirements for IACS components

## 1 Scope

```
This part of IEC 6 2443 provides detailed technical control system component requirements
(CRs) associated with the seven foundational requirements (FRs) described in IEC TS 62443 -
1-1 including defining the requirements for control system capability security levels and their
components, SL-C(component).
```
```
As defined in IEC TS 62443 -1-1 there are a total of seven foundational requirements (FRs):
```
```
a) i dentification and authentication control (IAC),
b) use control (UC),
c) system integrity (SI),
d) data confidentiality (DC),
e) restricted data flow (RDF),
f) timely response to events (TRE), and
g) resource availability (RA).
```
```
These seven FRs are the foundation for defining control system security capability levels.
Defining security capability levels for the control system component is the goal and objective
of this document as opposed to SL-T or achieved SLs (SL-A), which are out of scope.
```
```
NOTE 1 Refer to IEC 6 2443‑ 2 ‑ 1 [1] for an equivalent set of non-technical, program-related, capability
requirements necessary for fully achieving a SL-T(control system).

```
For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in IEC TS 62443-1-1,
IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3 and IEC 6 2443-4-1, and the following apply.
```
```
NOTE Many of the following terms and definitions are originally based on relevant International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and U.S. National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) sources, sometimes with minor modifications to enhance suitability for IACS security
requirements.
```
```
3.1.1
asset
physical or logical object having either a perceived or actual value to the IACS
```
```
Note 1 to entry: In this specific case, an asset is any item that should be protected as part of the IACS security
management system.
```
```
Note 2 to entry: An asset is not limited to the IACS alone, but can also include the physical assets under its
control
```
```
3.1.2
asset owner
individual or company responsible for one or more IACS
```
```
Note 1 to entry: Used in place of the generic term "end user" to provide differentiation.
```
```
Note 2 to entry: This includes the components that are part of the IACS.
```
```
Note 3 to entry: In the context of this document, an asset owner also includes the operator of the IACS.
```
```
3.1.3
attack
unauthorized attempt to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an IACS that
derives from an intelligent threat
```
```
EXAMPLE Intelligent act that is a deliberate attempt (especially in the sense of a method or technique) to evade
security services and violate the security policy of a system.
```
```
Note 1 to entry: There are different commonly recognized classes of attack:
```
- An "active attack" attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation.
- A "passive attack" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system
    resources.
- An "inside attack" is an attack initiated by an entity inside the security perimeter (an "insider"), for example, an
    entity that is authorized to access system resources but uses them in a way not approved by those who granted
    the authorization.
- An "outside attack" is initiated from outside the perimeter, by an unauthorized or illegitimate user of the system
    (including an insider attacking from outside the security perimeter). Potential outside attackers range from
    amateur pranksters to organized criminals, international terrorists and hostile governments.

```
3.1.4
authentication
verification of the claimed identity of an entity
```
```
Note 1 to entry: Authentication is usually a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in a control system.
```
```
3.1.5
authenticator
means used to confirm the identity of an entity
```
```
EXAMPLE A password or token may be used as an authenticator.
```
```

```



##### IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019 – 19 –

##### 3.1.6

```
authenticity
property that an entity is what it claims to be through authentication of origin and verification
of integrity
```
```
Note 1 to entry: Authenticity is typically used in the context of confidence in the identity of an entity, or the validity
of a transmission, a message or message originator.
```
```
3.1.7
availability
property of ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of control system information and
functionality
```
##### 3.1.8

```
communication channel
specific logical or physical communication link between assets

```
Note 1 to entry: A channel facilitates the establishment of a connection.
```
```
3.1.9
compensating countermeasure
countermeasure employed in lieu of or in addition to inherent security capabilities to satisfy
one or more security requirements
```
```
EXAMPLE
```
- (component-level): locked cabinet around a controller that otherwise might be exposed to unauthorized access
    via its physical data interfaces;
- (control system/zone-level): physical access control (guards, gates and guns) to protect a control room to
    restrict access to a group of known personnel to compensate for the technical requirement for personnel to be
    uniquely identified by the IACS; and
- (component-level): a product supplier’s programmable logic controller (PLC) cannot meet the access control
    capabilities from an asset owner, so the product supplier puts a firewall in front of the PLC and sells it as a
    system.

```
3.1.10
component
entity belonging to an IACS that exhibits the characteristics of one or more of a host device,
network device, software application, or embedded device
```
##### 3.1.11

```
conduit

the conduit is not impacted by the zone.
```
```
3.1.12
confidentiality
assurance that information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals, processes, or devices
```
```
Note 1 to entry: When used in the context of an IACS, confidentiality refers to protecting IACS data and
information from unauthorized access.
```
```

countermeasure
action, device, procedure or technique that reduces a threat, a vulnerability or the
consequences of an attack by minimizing the harm the attack can cause or by discovering and
reporting it so that corrective action can be taken
```
```
Note 1 to entry: The term “control” is also used to describe this concept in some contexts. The term
"countermeasure" has been chosen for this document to avoid confusion with the term “control” in the context of
“process control” and “control system”.
```
```
3.1.16
degraded mode
mode of operation in the presence of faults that have been anticipated in the design of the
control system
```
```
Note 1 to entry: Degraded modes allow the control system to continue to provide essential functions despite the
deficiency of one or several system elements, for example, malfunction or outage of control equipment, disruption
of communication due to failure or intentional system isolation in response to identified or suspected compromise
of subsystems.

### 3.3 Conventions

```
This document expands the SRs and REs defined in IEC 6 2443-3-3 into a series of CRs and
REs for the components contained within an IACS. To maintain ease of tracing the CRs to the
SRs in IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3 the CR numbering will match the associated SR. This will cause some
gaps and non-sequential numbering in this document. To provide clarity to the reader,
rationale and supplemental guidance is provided for each baseline requirement and notes for
any associated REs as is deemed necessary.
```
```
The types of components of an IACS as defined in this document are: software applications,
host devices, embedded devices and network devices. The majority of the CRs and REs are
applicable to all four types of components and are combined into a single component
requirement (CR). Some CRs and REs are unique to a specific type of component. These
component-type specific requirements have been separated into separate clauses for ease of
reference. Requirements specific to software applications, embedded devices, host devices,
and network devices are covered beginning with Clause 12. Where a component meets the
definition of one or more of software application, host device, embedded device or network
device, that component is expected to meet all of the requirements listed for each of the
component types it satisfies.
```
```
Each of the seven FRs defined in IEC TS 62443 ‑ 1 ‑1 has a defined set of four security levels
(SLs). These SLs are derived from the system security levels defined in IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3. A
component’s security level is described per FR, using the notation SL-C(FR, component), with
a corresponding value of 0 through 4. The control system capability level 0 for a particular FR
is implicitly defined as no requirements. The baseline requirement and REs, if present, for
each FR are then mapped to the component capability security level, SL-C(FR, component) 1
to 4.
```
```
For example, the purpose statement for Clause 8 is:
```
```
Ensure the confidentiality of information on communication channels and in data
repositories to prevent unauthorized disclosure.
```
```
The associated four SLs are defined as:
```
- SL 1 – Prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information via eavesdropping or casual
    exposure.
- SL 2 – Prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information to an entity actively
    searching for it using simple means with low resources, generic skills and low
    motivation.
- SL 3 – Prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information to an entity actively
    searching for it using sophisticated means with moderate resources, IACS specific
    skills and moderate motivation.
- SL 4 – Prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information to an entity actively
    searching for it using sophisticated means with extended resources, IACS specific
    skills and high motivation.

```
The individual CR and RE assignments are thus based on an incremental increase in overall
component security for that particular FR based on knowledge and expertise from the team
creating this document.
```
```
The SL-C(component), used throughout this document, signifies a capability required to meet
a given SL rating for a given CR. A complete description of the SL vector concept can be
found in IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3.
```
```

## 4 Common component security constraints

### 4.1 Overview...............................................................................................................

```
When reading, specifying and implementing the component CRs detailed in Clauses 5 through
15 of this document, there are a number of common constraints that are required to be
applied during the implementation of the requirements described in this document.
```
### 4.2 CCSC 1: Support of essential functions

```
The components of the system shall adhere to specific constraints as described in
IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3:2013, Clause 4.
```
### 4.3 CCSC 2: Compensating countermeasures

```
There will be cases where one or more requirements specified in this document cannot be
met without the assistance of a compensating countermeasure that is external to the
component. When this is the case the documentation for that component shall describe the
appropriate countermeasures applied by the system to allow the requirement to be met when
the component is integrated into a system.
```
### 4.4 CCSC 3: Least privilege

```
When required and appropriate, one or more system components (software applications,
embedded devices, host devices and network devices) shall provide the capability for the
system to enforce the concept of least privilege. Individual system components shall provide
the granularity of permissions and flexibility of mapping those permissions to roles sufficient
to support it. Individual accountability shall be available when required. Granularity of
permissions and assignment is dependent on the type of device and the product
documentation for the device should define this in the product documentation.
```
### 4.5 CCSC 4: Software development process

```
All of the components defined in this document shall be developed and supported following
the secure product development processes described in IEC 6 2443‑ 4 ‑1.
```
## 5 FR 1 – Identification and authentication control

### 5.1 Purpose and SL-C(IAC) descriptions

```
Identify and authenticate all users (humans, software processes and devices), prior to
allowing them access to the system or assets.
```
- SL 1 – Identify and authenticate all users (humans, software processes and devices)
    by mechanisms that protect against casual or coincidental access by unauthenticated
    entities.
- SL 2 – Identify and authenticate all users (humans, software processes and devices)
    by mechanisms that protect against intentional unauthenticated access by entities
    using simple means with low resources, generic skills and low motivation.
- SL 3 – Identify and authenticate all users (humans, software processes and devices)
    by mechanisms that protect against intentional unauthenticated access by entities
    using sophisticated means with moderate resources, IACS specific skills and moderate
    motivation.
- SL 4 – Identify and authenticate all users (humans, software processes and devices)
    by mechanisms that protect against intentional unauthenticated access by entities
    using sophisticated means with extended resources, IACS specific skills and high
    motivation.

```

```



##### – 28 – IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019

### 5.2 Rationale

```
Identification of users is used in conjunction with authorization mechanisms to implement
access control for a component. Verifying the identity of users requesting access is necessary
to protect against unauthorized users from gaining access to the component.
Recommendations and guidelines should include mechanisms that will operate in mixed
modes. For example, some components on a communication channel require strong access
control, such as strong authentication mechanisms, and others do not. By extension, access
control requirements need to be extended to data at rest.
```
```
It is recommended that the number of identification and authentication mechanisms within a
single zone is minimized. The use of multiple identification and authentication mechanisms
makes the task of authentication and identification management more difficult to administer.
```
### 5.3 CR 1.1 – Human user identification and authentication

#### 5.3.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to identify and authenticate all human users
according to IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑ 3 SR 1.1 on all interfaces capable of human user access. This
capability shall enforce such identification and authentication on all interfaces that provide
human user access to the component to support segregation of duties and least privilege in
accordance with applicable security policies and procedures. This capability may be provided
locally by the component or by integration into a system level identification and authentication
system.
```
```
NOTE Applicable security policies are a local matter.
```
#### 5.3.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
All human users need to be identified and authenticated for all access to the component.
Authentication of the identity of these users should be accomplished by using methods such
as passwords, tokens, biometrics or physically keyed lids, and in the case of multifactor
authentication, some combination thereof. The geographic location of human users can also
be used as part of the authentication process. This requirement should be applied to both
local and remote access to the component. This requirement comes in addition to the
requirement of having such an authentication and identification at the system level.
```
```
Interfaces capable of human user access are local user interfaces such as touchscreens,
push buttons, keyboards, as well as network protocols designed for human user interactions
such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), HTTP secure (HTTPS), file transfer protocol
(FTP), secure FTP (SFTP), protocols used for device configuration tools (which are
sometimes proprietary and other times use open protocols). User identification and
authentication may be role-based or group-based (such as, for some component interfaces,
several users may share the same identity). User identification and authentication should not
hamper fast, local emergency actions.
```
```
In order to support IAC policies, as defined according to IEC 6 2443‑ 2 ‑1 [1], the component
should verify the identity of all human users as a first step. In a second step, the permissions
assigned to the identified human user should be enforced (see 6.3).
```
#### 5.3.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Unique identification and authentication:
Components shall provide the capability to uniquely identify and authenticate all human
users.
(2) Multifactor authentication for all interfaces
Components shall provide the capability to employ multifactor authentication for all human
user access to the component.
```
```

```



##### IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019 – 29 –

#### 5.3.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four security levels that relate to CR 1.1 are:
```
- SL-C(IAC,component) 1: CR 1.1
- SL-C(IAC,component) 2: CR 1.1 (1)
- SL-C(IAC,component) 3: CR 1.1 (1) (2)
- SL-C(IAC,component) 4: CR 1.1 (1) (2)

### 5.4 CR 1.2 – Software process and device identification and authentication

#### 5.4.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to identify itself and authenticate to any other
component (software application, embedded devices, host devices and network devices),
according to IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3 SR1.2.
```
```
If the component, as in the case of an application, is running in the context of a human user,
in addition, the identification and authentication of the human user according to
IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3 SR1.1 may be part of the component identification and authentication process
towards the other components.
```
#### 5.4.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
The function of identification and authentication is to map a known identity to an unknown
software process or device (henceforth referred to as an entity in 5.4.2) so as to make it
known before allowing any data exchange. Allowing rogue entities to send and receive control
system specific data can result in detrimental behaviour of the control system.
```
```
All entities should be identified and authenticated for all access to the control system.
Authentication of the identity of such entities should be accomplished by using methods such
as passwords, tokens or location (physical or logical). This requirement should be applied to
both local and remote access to the control system. However, in some scenarios where
individual entities are used to connect to different target systems (for example, remote vendor
support), it may be technically infeasible for an entity to have multiple identities. In these
cases, compensating countermeasures would have to be applied.
```
```
Special attention needs to be given when identifying and authenticating portable and mobile
devices. These types of devices are a known method of introducing undesired network traffic,
malware and/or information exposure to control systems, including otherwise isolated
networks.
```
```
Where entities function as a single group, identification and authentication may be role-based,
group-based or entity-based. It is essential that local emergency actions as well as control
system essential functions not be hampered by identification or authentication requirements
(see Clause 4 for a more complete discussion). For example, in common protection and
control schemes, a group of devices jointly execute the protection functions and communicate
with multicast messages among the devices in the group. In these cases, group authentication
based on shared accounts or shared symmetric keys are commonly used.
```
```
In order to support identification and authentication control policies as defined according to
IEC 6 2443‑ 2 ‑1 [1], the control system verifies the identity of all entities as a first step. In a
second step, the permissions assigned to the identified entity are enforced (see 6.3).
```
#### 5.4.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Unique identification and authentication
Components shall provide the capability to uniquely identify and authenticate itself to any
other component.

```



##### – 30 – IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019

#### 5.4.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four security levels that relate to CR 1.2 are:
```
- SL-C(IAC,component) 1: Not selected
- SL-C(IAC,component) 2: CR 1.2
- SL-C(IAC,component) 3: CR 1.2 (1)
- SL-C(IAC,component) 4: CR 1.2 (1)

### 5.5 CR 1.3 – Account management

#### 5.5.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to support the management of all accounts directly or
integrated into a system that manages accounts according to IEC 6 2443 ‑ 3 ‑3 SR 1.3.
```
#### 5.5.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
A component may provide this capability by integrating into a higher-level account
management system. If the capability is not integrated into a higher-level account
management system then the component is expected to provide the capability natively.
```
```
A common approach meeting this requirement would be a component that delegates the
valuation of authentication to a directory server (for example, LDAP or Active Directory) which
provides the account management capabilities required by IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3 SR 1.3.
```
```
When a component integrates into a higher-level system to provide the account management
capabilities there needs to be consideration for the impact to the component in the event that
the higher-level system capability becomes unavailable.
```
#### 5.5.3 Requirement enhancements

```
None
```
#### 5.5.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four security levels that relate to CR 1.3 are:
```
- SL-C(IAC,component) 1: CR 1.3
- SL-C(IAC,component) 2: CR 1.3
- SL-C(IAC,component) 3: CR 1.3
- SL-C(IAC,component) 4: CR 1.3

### 5.6 CR 1.4 – Identifier management

#### 5.6.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to integrate into a system that supports the
management of identifiers and/or provide the capability to support the management of
identifiers directly according to IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3 SR 1.4.
```
#### 5.6.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Accounts created under CR 1.3 – Account management ( 5.5) require the use of one or more
identifiers to distinctly identify each account. These identifiers should be unique and
unambiguous as to the account with which they are associated. Some examples of identifiers
in common use are account names, UNIX user IDs, Microsoft Windows account globally
unique identifiers (GUID), and bound X.509 certificates. A component may provide a local

```



##### IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019 – 31 –

```
capability to associate identifiers with accounts. If the component is integrated into a system
that enforces a system-wide security policy, it is highly recommended that identifiers be
associated with the same account across all components in the system. In order to
accomplish this, a component should be able to integrate into a system-wide identifier
management capability.
```
#### 5.6.3 Requirement enhancements

```
None
```
#### 5.6.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four security levels that relate to CR 1.4 are:
```
- SL-C(IAC,component) 1: CR 1.4
- SL-C(IAC,component) 2: CR 1.4
- SL-C(IAC,component) 3: CR 1.4
- SL-C(IAC,component) 4: CR 1.4

### 5.7 CR 1.5 – Authenticator management

#### 5.7.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to:
```
```
a) support the use of initial authenticator content;
b) support the recognition of changes to default authenticators made at installation time;
c) function properly with periodic authenticator change/refresh operation; and
d) protect authenticators from unauthorized disclosure and modification when stored, used
and transmitted.
```
#### 5.7.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
In addition to an identifier (see 5.6) an authenticator is required to prove identity. Control
system authenticators include, but are not limited to, tokens, symmetric keys, private keys
(part of a public/private key pair), biometrics, passwords, physical keys and key cards. There
should be security policies in place instructing human users to take reasonable measures to
safeguard authenticators, including maintaining possession of their individual authenticators,
not loaning or sharing authenticators with others and reporting lost or compromised
authenticators immediately.
```
```
Authenticators have a lifecycle. When an account is created automatically a new authenticator
needs to be created, in order for the account owner to be able to authenticate. For example,
in a password-based system, the account has a password associated with it. Definition of the
initial authenticator content could be interpreted as the administrator defining the initial
password that the account management system sets for all new accounts. Being able to
configure these initial values makes it harder for an attacker to guess the password between
account creation and first account use (which should involve the setting of a new password by
the account owner). Some control systems are installed with unattended installers that create
all necessary accounts with default passwords and some embedded devices are shipped with
default passwords. Over time, these passwords often become general knowledge and are
documented on the Internet. Being able to change the default passwords protects the system
against unauthorized users using default passwords to gain access. Passwords can be
obtained from storage or from transmission when used in network authentication. The
complexity of this can be increased by cryptographic protections such as encryption or
hashing or by handshake protocols that do not require transmission of the password at all.
Still, passwords might be subject to attacks, for example, brute force guessing or breaking the
cryptographic protection of passwords in transit or storage. The window of opportunity can be
reduced by changing/refreshing the passwords periodically. Similar considerations apply to

```



##### – 32 – IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019

```
authentication systems based on cryptographic keys. Enhanced protection can be achieved
by using hardware mechanisms such as hardware security modules like trusted platform
modules (TPMs).
```
```
The management of authenticators should be specified in applicable security policies and
procedures, for example, constraints to change default authenticators, refresh periods,
specification of the protection of authenticators or firecall procedures.
```
```
Besides the capabilities for authenticator management specified in this requirement, the
strength of the authentication mechanism depends on the strength of the chosen authenticator
(for example, password complexity or key length in public key authentication) and the policies
for validating the authenticator in the authentication process (for example, how long a
password is valid or which checks are performed in public key certificate validation). For the
most common authentication mechanisms, password-based and public key authentication,
5.9, 5.10 and 5.11 provide further requirements.
```
```
Use of components for some operations may be restricted, requiring additional authentication
(such as tokens, keys and certificates) in order to perform some functions.
```
#### 5.7.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Hardware security for authenticators
The authenticators on which the component rely shall be protected via hardware
mechanisms.
```
```
EXAMPLE Password protected memory, OTP memory, hardware data integrity checks, and device security boot
mechanism.
```
#### 5.7.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four security levels that relate to CR 1.5 are:
```
- SL-C(IAC,component) 1: CR 1.5
- SL-C(IAC,component) 2: CR 1.5
- SL-C(IAC,component) 3: CR 1.5 (1)
- SL-C(IAC,component) 4: CR 1.5 (1)

### 5.8 CR 1.6 – Wireless access management

```
The wireless access management requirements are network-component-specific and can be
located as requirements for network-components in Clause 15.
```
```
5.9 CR 1.7 – Strength of password-based authentication
```
#### 5.9.1 Requirement

```
For components that utilize password-based authentication, those components shall provide
or integrate into a system that provides the capability to enforce configurable password
strength according to internationally recognized and proven password guidelines.
```
#### 5.9.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
The ability to enforce configurable password strength, whether it is based on minimum length,
variety of characters, or duration of time (the minimum being a one-time password) is
necessary to assist in increasing the overall security of user chosen passwords. Generally
accepted practices and recommendations can be found in documents such as [20].
```
#### 5.9.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Password generation and lifetime restrictions for human users

```



##### IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019 – 33 –

```
Components shall provide, or integrate into a system that provides, the capability to
protect against any given human user account from reusing a password for a configurable
number of generations. In addition, the component shall provide the capability to enforce
password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions for human users. These capabilities
shall conform to commonly accepted security industry practices. The component should
provide the capability to prompt the user to change their password upon a configurable
time prior to expiration.
(2) Password lifetime restrictions for all users ( human, software process, or device)
Components shall provide, or integrate into a system that provides, the capability to
enforce password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions for all users.
```
#### 5.9.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four security levels that relate to CR 1.7 are:
```
- SL-C(IAC,component) 1: CR 1.7
- SL-C(IAC,component) 2: CR 1.7
- SL-C(IAC,component) 3: CR 1.7 (1)
- SL-C(IAC,component) 4: CR 1.7 (1) (2)

### 5.10 CR 1.8 – Public key infrastructure certificates

#### 5.10.1 Requirement

```
When public key infrastructure (PKI) is utilized, the component shall provide or integrate into
a system that provides the capability to interact and operate in accordance with IEC 6 2443-3-
3 SR1.8.
```
#### 5.10.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
The selection of an appropriate PKI should consider the organization’s certificate policy which
should be based on the risk associated with a breach of confidentiality of the protected
information. Guidance on the policy definition can be found in commonly accepted standards
and guidelines, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comment

### 5.11 CR 1.9 – Strength of public key-based authentication

#### 5.11.1 Requirement

```
For components that utilize public-key-based authentication, those components shall provide
directly or integrate into a system that provides the capability within the same IACS
environment to:
```
```
a) validate certificates by checking the validity of the signature of a given certificate;
b) validate the certificate chain or, in the case of self-signed certificates, by deploying leaf
certificates to all hosts that communicate with the subject to which the certificate is
issued;
c) validate certificates by checking a given certificate’s revocation status;
d) establish user (human, software process or device) control of the corresponding private
key;
e) map the authenticated identity to a user (human, software process or device); and
f) ensure that the algorithms and keys used for the public key authentication conform to 8.5.
```
#### 5.11.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
To meet the requirements in 5.11.1 does not necessarily require a real time connection to a
certificate authority. Alternative out-of-band methods may be used to meet the requirements
in 5.11.1. For example, a disconnected system could install and update certifications using
manual out-of-band processes.
```
```
Public/private key cryptography strongly depends on the secrecy of a given subject’s private
key and proper handling of the trust relationships. When verifying a trust between two entities
based on public key authentication, it is essential to trace the public key certificate to a
trusted entity. A common implementation error in certificate validation is to only check the
validity of a certificate’s signature, but not checking the trust in the signer. In a PKI setting, a
signer is trusted if they are a trusted CA or have a certificate issued by a trusted CA, thus all
verifiers need to trace certificates presented to them back to a trusted CA. If such a chain of
trusted CAs cannot be established, the presented certificate should not be trusted.
```
```
If self-signed certificates are used instead of a PKI, the certificate subject itself signed its
certificate, thus there never is a trusted third-party or CA. This should be compensated by
deploying the self-signed public key certificates to all peers that need to validate them via an
otherwise secured mechanism (for example, configuration of all peers in a trusted
environment). Trusted certificates need to be distributed to peers through secure channels.
During the validation process, a self-signed certificate should only be trusted if it is already
present in the list of trusted certificates of the validating peer. The set of trusted certificates
should be configured to the minimum necessary set.
```
```
In both cases, validation needs to also consider the possibility that a certificate is revoked. In
a PKI setting this is typically done by maintaining certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or running
an online certificate status protocol (OCSP) server. When revocation checking is not available
due to control system constraints, mechanisms such as a short certificate lifetime can
compensate for the lack of timely revocation information. Note that short lifetime certificates
can sometimes create significant operational issues in a control system environment.
```
```
It is expected that most components will integrate into an IACS and leverage the key
authentication mechanisms provided by the underlying IACS. When implementing public key
authentication at the component-level of an IACS, protection of the key becomes a primary
concern and objective of key storage on that component. Care should be taken in the
implementation to ensure that any private keys stored within the component cannot be
retrieved or tampered with (see 5.7).
```
```
NOTE Tamper resistant design methodologies and technologies are available to assist with designing a secure
private key protection mechanism.

### 5.12 CR 1.10 – Authenticator feedback

#### 5.12.1 Requirement

```
When a component provides an authentication capability, the component shall provide the
capability to obscure feedback of authenticator information during the authentication process.
```
#### 5.12.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Obscuring feedback protects the information from possible exploitation by unauthorized
individuals, for example, displaying asterisks or other random characters when a human user
types in a username and/or password obscures feedback of authentication information. Other
examples include the entry of secure socket shell (SSH) token and one-time passwords. The
authenticating entity should not provide any hint as to the reason for the authentication
fa ilure, such as “unknown user name.”

- SL-C(IAC,component) 4: CR 1.10

### 5.13 CR 1.11 – Unsuccessful login attempts

#### 5.13.1 Requirement

```
When a component provides an authentication capability, the component shall provide the
capability to:
```
```
a) enforce a limit of a configurable number of consecutive invalid access attempts by any
user (human, software process or device) during a configurable time period; and
b) deny access for a specified period of time or until unlocked by an administrator when this
limit has been reached. An administrator may unlock an account prior to the expiration of
the timeout period.
```
```

```



## – 4 – IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC

#### 5.13.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Due to the potential for denial of service, the number of consecutive invalid access attempts
may be limited. If enabled, the application or device may automatically reset to zero the
number of access attempts after a predetermined time period established by the applicable
security policies and procedures. Resetting the access attempts to zero will allow users
(human, software process or device) to gain access if they have the correct login credentials.
Automatic (without human intervention) denial of access for control system operator
workstations or nodes should not be used when immediate operator responses are required in
emergency situations. All lockout mechanisms should consider functional requirements for
continuous operations so as to mitigate adverse denial of service operating conditions which
could result in system failures or compromising the safety of the system. Allowing interactive
logins to an account used for critical services could provide a potential for denial of service or
other abuse.

### 5.14 CR 1.12 – System use notification

#### 5.14.1 Requirement

```
When a component provides local human user access/HMI, it shall provide the capability to
display a system use notification message before authenticating. The system use notification
message shall be configurable by authorized personnel.
```
#### 5.14.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Privacy and security policies and procedures need to be consistent with applicable laws,
directives, policies, regulations, standards and guidance. Often, the main justification for this
requirement is legal prosecution of violators and proving intentional breach. This capability is
thus necessary to support policy requirements, and might improve IACS security because it
can be used as a deterrent. System use notification messages can be implemented in the
form of warning banners displayed when individuals log in to the control system. A warning
banner implemented as a posted physical notice in the control system facility does not protect
against remote login issues.
```
```
Examples of elements for inclusion in the system use notification message are:
```
```
a) that the individual is accessing a system owned by the asset owner;
b) that system usage may be monitored, recorded and subject to audit;
c) that unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and subject to criminal and/or civil
penalties; and
d) that use of the system indicates consent to monitoring and recording.

### 5.15 CR 1.13 – Access via untrusted networks

```
The access via untrusted networks requirements are component-specific and can be located
as requirements for each specific component type in Clauses 12 through 15.
```
### 5.16 CR 1.14 – Strength of symmetric key-based authentication

#### 5.16.1 Requirement

```
For components that utilize symmetric keys, the component shall provide the capability to:
```
```
a) establish the mutual trust using the symmetric key;
b) store securely the shared secret (the authentication is valid as long as the shared secret
remains secret);
c) restrict access to the shared secret; and
d) ensure that the algorithms and keys used for the symmetric key authentication conform to
8.5.
```
#### 5.16.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Means should be defined for installing the keys into the component. This may include
installing and managing the component key using out-of-band methods. This is necessary
since a compromise of any symmetric keys that are stored within the component could lead to
a full compromise of the system using those keys.
```
```
In practice, there are two basic ways to perform the secure authentication of a device to
another: either using asymmetric cryptography (see 5.11) or by using symmetric cryptography.
The choice between asymmetric and symmetric is dictated by several criteria, like key
management, trust provisioning, legacy support and efficiency. Examples of symmetric key
authentication schemes are Needham-Schröder or Kerberos. When symmetric key
authentication is used, the party uses a secret key they have learned in the past (for example,
through trust provisioning). The party proves their claimed identity by proving knowledge of
the secret key (for example, by answering a challenge submitted by the other party, the
examiner). The examiner has the knowledge of the same secret (also learned in the past
through trust provisioning) and is able to compute the answer to the challenge performing the
same cryptographic operations as the prover. The examiner can then compare the answer of
the prover with its own computation. If they match, the examiner is convinced that the prover
is the one they claim to be and the process can be conducted the other way around, switching
roles, to achieve mutual-authentication. This mechanism is secure only if the shared secret is
only known by the prover and the examiner and if the secret is diversified per prover. One
instance of such a mechanism is the proper use of cipher-based message authentication code
(CMAC) computations or alternatively the Galois counter mode (GCM)/ Galois message
authentication code (GMAC) operation modes.

(1) Hardware security for symmetric key-based authentication
Components shall provide the capability to protect critical, long lived symmetric keys via
hardware mechanisms.

## 6 FR 2 – Use control.........................................................................................................

### 6.1 Purpose and SL-C(UC) descriptions

```
Enforce the assigned privileges of an authenticated user (human, software process or device)
to perform the requested action on the component and monitor the use of these privileges.
```
- SL 1 – Restrict use of the IACS according to specified privileges to protect against
    casual or coincidental misuse.
- SL 2 – Restrict use of the IACS according to specified privileges to protect against
    circumvention by entities using simple means with low resources, generic skills and
    low motivation.
- SL 3 – Restrict use of the IACS according to specified privileges to protect against
    circumvention by entities using sophisticated means with moderate resources, IACS
    specific skills and moderate motivation.
- SL 4 – Restrict use of the IACS according to specified privileges to protect against
    circumvention by entities using sophisticated means with extended resources, IACS
    specific skills and high motivation.

### 6.2 Rationale

```
Once the user is identified and authenticated, the component should restrict the allowed
actions to the authorized use of the component. Asset owners and system integrators will
have to assign, to each user (human, software process or device), group, role, etc. (see 4.5),
the privileges defining the authorized use of the component. The goal of use control is to
protect against unauthorized actions on the component’s resources by verifying that the
necessary privileges have been granted before allowing a user to perform the actions.
Examples of actions are reading or writing data, downloading programs and setting
configurations. Recommendations and guidelines should include mechanisms that will operate
in mixed modes. For example, some component resources require strong use control
protection, such as restrictive privileges, and others do not. By extension, use control
requirements should be extended to data at rest. User privileges may vary based on time-of-
day/date, location and means by which access is made.
```
### 6.3 CR 2.1 – Authorization enforcement

#### 6.3.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide an authorization enforcement mechanism for all identified and
authenticated users based on their assigned responsibilities.
```
#### 6.3.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Use control policies (for example, identity-based policies, role-based policies and rule-based
policies) and associated read/write access enforcement mechanisms (for example, access
control lists, access control matrices and cryptography) are employed to control usage
between users (humans, software processes and devices) and assets (for example, devices,
files, records, software processes, programs and domains).
```
```

```



##### IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019 – 39 –

```
After the control system has verified the identity of a user (human, software process or
device) (see 5.3 and 5.4), it also has to verify that a requested operation is actually permitted
according to the defined security policies and procedures. For example, in a role-based
access control policy, the control system would check which roles are assigned to a verified
user or asset and which privileges are assigned to these roles – if the requested operation is
covered by the permissions, it is executed, otherwise rejected. This allows the enforcement of
segregation of duties and least privileges. Usage enforcement mechanisms should not be
allowed to adversely affect the operational performance of the control system.
```
```
Planned or unplanned changes to control system components can have significant effects on
the overall security of the control system. Accordingly, only qualified and authorized
individuals should obtain the use of control system components for purposes of initiating
changes, including upgrades and modifications.
```
#### 6.3.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Authorization enforcement for all users (humans, software processes and devices)
Components shall provide an authorization enforcement mechanism for all users based on
their assigned responsibilities and least privilege.
(2) Permission mapping to roles
Components shall, directly or through a compensating security mechanism, provide for an
authorized role to define and modify the mapping of permissions to roles for all human
users.
Roles should not be limited to fixed nested hierarchies in which a higher-level role is a
super set of a lesser privileged role. For example, a system administrator should not
necessarily encompass operator privileges.
```
```
NOTE 1 This RE is applicable to software processes and devices as well.
(3) Supervisor override
Components shall support a supervisor manual override for a configurable time or
sequence of events.
```
```
NOTE 2 Implementation of a controlled, audited and manual override of automated mechanisms in the event
of emergencies or other serious events allows a supervisor to enable an operator to quickly react to unusual
conditions without closing the current session and establishing a new session as a higher privilege human
user.
(4) Dual approval
Components shall support dual approval when action can result in serious impact on the
industrial process.
Dual approval should be limited to actions which require a very high level of confidence
that they will be performed reliably and correctly. Requiring dual approval provides
emphasis to the seriousness of consequences that would result from failure of a correct
action. An example of a situation in which dual approval is required would be a change to
a set point of a critical industrial process. Dual approval mechanisms should not be
employed when an immediate response is necessary to safeguard HSE consequences, for
example, emergency shutdown of an industrial process.
```

#### 6.4.1 Requirement

```
If a component supports usage through wireless interfaces it shall provide the capability to
integrate into the system that supports usage authorization, monitoring and restrictions
according to commonly accepted industry practices.
```
#### 6.4.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Wireless use control may be implemented in different devices that make up the system.
Network devices may be one of the devices that assist with use control through controls such
as network admission control. For devices and applications that utilize wireless networks
those devices should be able to properly utilize wireless network protection such as network
admission control. Components may also implement different limitations on access based on
whether the access is from wireless devices or wired devices. This does place a need that the
component be able to distinguish whether the interface is through wireless or not. Some
network devices provide the capability to scan for unauthorized wireless network activity in
the wireless spectrum. In order to prevent a negative impact on the performance of the control
system functionality, it is a good practice to deploy dedicated devices to perform checks for
unauthorized network activity.

```
If a component provides a human user interface, whether accessed locally or via a network,
the component shall provide the capability

```
a) to protect against further access by initiating a session lock after a configurable time
period of inactivity or by manual initiation by the user (human, software process or
device); and
b) for the session lock to remain in effect until the human user who owns the session, or
another authorized human user, re -establishes access using appropriate identification and
authentication procedures.
```
```

```



##### IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019 – 41 –

#### 6.7.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Session locks are used to prevent access to specified workstations or nodes. Components
should activate session lock mechanisms automatically after a configurable time period. In
most cases, the session locks are configured at the system level. Session locks implemented
as part of this requirement may be pre-empted or limited by remote session termination, as
defined in 6.8.

If a component supports remote sessions, the component shall provide the capability to
terminate a remote session either automatically after a configurable time period of inactivity,
manually by a local authority, or manually by the user (human, software process or device)
who initiated the session.
```
#### 6.8.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
A remote session is initiated whenever a component is accessed across the boundary of a
zone defined by the asset owner based on their risk assessment. This requirement may be
limited to sessions that are used for component monitoring and maintenance activities (not
critical operations) based on the risk assessment of the control system and security policies
and procedures. Some components may not allow sessions to be terminated as the session
might be part of an essential function of the component.

A resource starvation DoS might occur if a limit is not imposed. There is a trade-off between
potentially locking out a specific user versus locking out all users and services due to a lack
of resources. Product supplier and/or system integrator guidance is likely required to provide
sufficient information as to how the number of concurrent sessions value should be assigned.

```
a) access control;
b) request errors;
c) control system events;
d) backup and restore event;
e) configuration changes; and
f) audit log events.

a) provide the capability to allocate audit record storage capacity according to commonly
recognized recommendations for log management; and
b) provide mechanisms to protect against a failure of the component when it reaches or
exceeds the audit storage capacity.

#### 6.11.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Components should provide sufficient audit storage capacity, and should consider retention
policy, the auditing to be performed and the online audit processing requirements.
Components may rely on the system into which they are integrated to provide the majority of
audit storage capacity. However, the components should provide enough local storage to
buffer audit data until it can be sent to the system.
```

Guidelines to be considered may include NIST Special Publication (SP) 800- 92 [19]. The audit
storage capacity should be sufficient to retain logs for a period of time required by applicable
policies and regulations or business requirements.

a) provide the capability to protect against the loss of essential services and functions in the
event of an audit processing failure; and
b) provide the capability to support appropriate actions in response to an audit processing
failure according to commonly accepted industry practices and recommendations.
```
```

```



##### – 44 – IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019

#### 6.12.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Audit generation typically occurs at the source of the event. Audit processing involves
transmission, possible augmentation (such as, the addition of a timestamp) and persistent
storage of the audit records. Audit processing failures include, for example, software or
hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms and audit storage capacity being
reached or exceeded. Guidelines to be considered when designing appropriate response
actions may include the NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management [19].
It should be noted that either overwriting the oldest audit records or halting audit log
generation are possible responses to audit storage capacity being exceeded but imply the
loss of potentially essential forensic information. Also alerting personnel could be an
appropriate supporting action in response to an audit processing failure.

```
A good reference for the format of timestamps is ISO/IEC 8601:2004 [7]. Care should be
taken when designing a system that periodic time-shift events, such as daylight savings time
in some locations, are considered.

### 6.14 CR 2.12 – Non-repudiation

#### 6.14.1 Requirement

```
If a component provides a human user interface, the component shall provide the capability to
determine whether a given human user took a particular action.
```
```
Control elements that are not able to support such capability shall be listed in component
documents.
```
#### 6.14.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Examples of particular actions taken by a user include performing operator actions, changing
control system configurations, creating information, sending a message, approving
information (such as, indicating concurrence) and receiving a message. Non-repudiation
protects against later false claims by a user of not having taken a specific action, by an author
of not having authored a particular document, by a sender of not having transmitted a
message, by a receiver of not having received a message or by a signatory of not having
signed a document. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information
originated from a user, if a user took specific actions (for example, sending an email and
approving a work order) or received specific information. Non-repudiation services are
obtained by employing various techniques or mechanisms (for example, user identification
and authorization, digital signatures, digital message receipts and timestamps).
```
#### 6.14.3 Requirement enhancements

##### – 46 – IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019

### 7.2 Rationale

```
Components often go through multiple testing cycles (unit testing, system testing, etc.) before
they begin production to establish that the components will perform as intended before they
even begin production. Once operational, asset owners are responsible for maintaining the
integrity of the component. Using their risk assessment methodology, asset owners may
assign different levels of integrity protection to different components, communication channels
and information in their IACS. The integrity of physical assets should be maintained in both
operational and non-operational states, such as during production, when in storage or during
a maintenance shutdown. The integrity of logical assets should be maintained while in transit
and at rest, such as being transmitted over a network or when residing in a data repository.
```
```
7.3 CR 3.1 – Communication integrity
```
#### 7.3.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to protect integrity of transmitted information.
```
#### 7.3.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Many common network attacks are based on the manipulation of data in transmission, for
example manipulation of network packets. Switched or routed networks provide a greater
opportunity for attackers to manipulate packets as undetected access to these networks is
generally easier and the switching and routing mechanisms themselves can also be
manipulated in order to get more access to transmitted information. Manipulation in the
context of a control system could include the change of measurement values communicated
from a sensor to a receiver or the alteration of command parameters sent from a control
application to an actuator.
```
```
Depending on the context (for example transmission within a local network segment versus
transmission via untrusted networks) and the network type used in the transmission (for
example transmission control protocol (TCP)/Internet protocol (IP) versus local serial links),
feasible and appropriate mechanisms will vary. On a small network with direct links (point-to-
point), physical access protection to all nodes may be sufficient on lower SLs if the endpoints’
integrity is protected as well (see 7.6), while on a network distributed in areas with regular
physical presence of staff or on a wide area network, physical access is likely not
enforceable. If a commercial service is used to provide communication services as a
commodity item rather than a fully dedicated service (for example a leased line versus a T1
link), it may be more difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the
implementation of needed security controls for communication integrity (for example because
of legal restrictions). When it is infeasible or impractical to meet the necessary security
requirements it may be appropriate to implement either appropriate compensating
countermeasures or explicitly accept the additional risk.
```
```
Industrial equipment is often subject to environmental conditions that can lead to integrity
issues and/or false positive incidents. The environment often contains particulates, liquids,
vibration, gases, radiation, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) that can cause conditions
that affect the integrity of the communication wiring and signals. The network infrastructure
should be designed to minimize these physical/environmental effects on communication
integrity. For example, when particulate, liquids, and/or gases are an issue, it may be
necessary to use a sealed registered jack 45 (RJ-45) or M12 connector instead of a
commercial-grade RJ-45 connector on the wire. The cable itself may need to use a different
jacket instead to handle the particulate, liquid, and/or gas as well. In cases where vibration is
an issue, M12 connectors may be necessary to prevent the spring pins on an RJ-45 connector
from disconnecting during use. In cases where radiation and/or EMI are an issue, it may be
necessary to use shielded twisted pair or fiber cables to prevent any effect on the
communication signals. It may also be necessary to perform a wireless spectrum analysis in
these areas if wireless networking is planned to verify that it is a viable solution.

```
- SL-C(SI, component) 1: CR 3.1
- SL-C(SI, component) 2: CR 3.1 (1)

### 7.4 CR 3.2 – Protection from malicious code

```
The protection from malicious code requirements are component-specific and can be located
as requirements for each specific component type in Clauses 12 through 15.
```
### 7.5 CR 3.3 – Security functionality verification

#### 7.5.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to support verification of the intended operation of
security functions according to IEC 6 2443-3-3 SR3.3.
```
#### 7.5.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
The product supplier and/or system integrator should provide guidance on how to test the
designed security controls. Asset owners need to be aware of the possible ramifications of
running these verification tests during normal operations. Details of the execution of these
verifications need to be specified with careful consideration of the requirements for continuous
operations (for example, scheduling or prior notification).
```
```
Examples of security verification functions include:
```
- Verification of antivirus countermeasures by European Institute for Computer Antivirus
    Research (EICAR) testing of the control system file system. Antivirus software should
    detect the EICAR test samples and appropriate incident handling procedures should be
    triggered.
- Verification of the identification, authentication and use control countermeasures by
    attempting access with an unauthorized account (for some functionality this could be
    automated).
- Verification of intrusion detection systems (IDSs) as a security control by including a
    rule in the IDS that triggers on irregular, but known non-malicious traffic. The test
    could then be performed by introducing traffic that triggers this rule and the appropriate
    IDS monitoring and incident handling procedures.
- Confirmation that audit logging is occurring as required by security policies and
    procedures and has not been disabled by an internal or external entity.

#### 7.5.3 Requirement enhancements

- SL-C(SI, component) 4: CR 3.3 (1)

### 7.6 CR 3.4 – Software and information integrity

#### 7.6.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to perform or support integrity checks on software,
configuration and other information as well as the recording and reporting of the results of
these checks or be integrated into a system that can perform or support integrity checks.
```
#### 7.6.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Integrity verification methods are employed to detect, record, report and protect against
software and information tampering that may occur if other protection mechanisms (such as
authorization enforcement) have been circumvented. Components should employ formal or
recommended integrity mechanisms (such as cryptographic hashes). For example, such
mechanisms could be used to monitor field devices for their latest configuration information to
detect security breaches (including unauthorized changes).
```
#### 7.6.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Authenticity of software and information
Components shall provide the capability to perform or support authenticity checks on
software, configuration and other information as well as the recording and reporting of the
results of these checks or be integrated into a system that can perform or support
authenticity checks.
(2) Automated notification of integrity violations
If the component is performing the integrity check, it shall be capable of automatically
providing notification to a configurable entity upon discovery of an attempt to make an
unauthorized change.
```

- SL-C(SI, component) 3: CR 3.4 (1) (2)
- SL-C(SI, component) 4: CR 3.4 (1) (2)

### 7.7 CR 3.5 – Input validation

#### 7.7.1 Requirement

```
Components shall validate the syntax, length and content of any input data that is used as an
industrial process control input or input via external interfaces that directly impacts the action
of the component.
```
```

```



##### IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019 – 49 –

#### 7.7.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Rules for checking the valid syntax of input data such as set points should be in place to
verify that this information has not been tampered with and conforms to the specification.
Inputs passed to interpreters should be pre-screened to prevent the content from being
unintentionally interpreted as commands. Note that this is a security CR, thus it does not
address human error, for example supplying a legitimate integer number which is outside the
expected range.
```
```
Generally accepted industry practices for input data validation include out-of-range values for
a defined field type, invalid characters in data fields, missing or incomplete data and buffer
overflow. Additional examples where invalid inputs lead to system security issues include SQL
injection attacks, cross-site scripting or malformed packets (as commonly generated by
protocol fuzzers). Guidelines to be considered should include well-known guidelines such as
the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Code Review Guide [21].

### 7.8 CR 3.6 – Deterministic output

#### 7.8.1 Requirement

```
Components that physically or logically connect to an automation process shall provide the
capability to set outputs to a predetermined state if normal operation as defined by the
component supplier cannot be maintained.
```
#### 7.8.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
The deterministic behaviour of control system outputs as a result of threat actions against the
control system devices and software is an important characteristic to ensure the integrity of
normal operations. Ideally, the device continues to operate normally while under attack, but if
the control system cannot maintain normal operation, then the control system outputs need to
fail to a predetermined state. The appropriate predetermined state of control system outputs
is device dependent and could be one of the following user configurable options:
```
- Unpowered – the outputs fail to the unpowered state;
- Hold – the outputs fail to the last-k nown good value; or
- Fixed – the outputs fail to a fixed value that is determined by the asset owner or an
    application; or
- Dynamic – the outputs fail to one of the above options based on the current state.

### 7.9 CR 3.7 – Error handling

#### 7.9.1 Requirement

```
Components shall identify and handle error conditions in a manner that does not provide
information that could be exploited by adversaries to attack the IACS.
```
#### 7.9.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
The product supplier and/or system integrator should carefully consider the structure and
content of error messages. Error messages generated by the component should provide
timely and useful information without revealing potentially harmful information that could be
used by adversaries to exploit the IACS. Disclosure of this information should be justified by
the necessity for timely resolution of error conditions. Guidelines to be considered could
include well-known guidelines such as the OWASP Code Review Guide.
```
```
A good example of an error message that could help adversaries attack an IACS would be to
provide details of why authentication with the system failed. For example, stating invalid user
or invalid password in the feedback would help an adversary attack the IACS and thus should
not be provided.

### 7.10 CR 3.8 – Session integrity.....................................................................................

#### 7.10.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide mechanisms to protect the integrity of communications sessions
including:
```
```
a) the capability to invalidate session identifiers upon user logout or other session
termination (including browser sessions);
b) the capability to generate a unique session identifier for each session and recognize only
session identifiers that are system-generated; and
c) the capability to generate unique session identifiers with commonly accepted sources of
randomness.
```
```

```



##### IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019 – 51 –

#### 7.10.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
This control focuses on communications protection at the session, versus packet, level. The
intent of this control is to establish grounds for confidence at each end of a communications
session in the ongoing identity of the other party and in the validity of the information being
transmitted. For example, this control addresses man-in-the-middle attacks including session
hijacking, insertion of false information into a session or replay attacks. Use of session
integrity mechanisms can have a significant overhead and therefore their use should be
considered in light of requirements for real-time communications.
```
```
Session hijacking and other man-in-the-middle attacks or injections of false information often
take advantage of easy-to -guess session IDs (keys or other shared secrets) or use of session
IDs that were not properly invalidated after session termination. Therefore the validity of a
session authenticator should be tightly connected to the lifetime of a session. Employing
randomness in the generation of unique session IDs helps to protect against brute-force
attacks to determine future session IDs.

```
Components shall protect audit information, audit logs, and audit tools (if present) from
unauthorized access, modification and deletion.
```
#### 7.11.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Audit information includes all information (for example, audit records, audit settings and audit
reports) needed to successfully audit control system activity. The audit information is
important for error correction, security breach recovery, investigations and related efforts.
Mechanisms for enhanced protection against modification and deletion include the storage of
audit information to hardware-enforced write-once media.

### 8.1 Purpose and SL-C(DC) descriptions

```
Ensure the confidentiality of information on communication channels and in data stored in
repositories to protect against unauthorized disclosure.
```
- SL 1 – Prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information via eavesdropping or casual
    exposure.
- SL 2 – Prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information to an entity actively
    searching for it using simple means with low resources, generic skills and low
    motivation.
- SL 3 – Prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information to an entity actively
    searching for it using sophisticated means with moderate resources, IACS specific
    skills and moderate motivation.
- SL 4 – Prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information to an entity actively
    searching for it using sophisticated means with extended resources, IACS specific
    skills and high motivation.

### 8.2 Rationale

```
Some component-generated information, whether at rest or in transit, is of a confidential or
sensitive nature. This implies that some communication channels and datastores require
protection against eavesdropping and unauthorized access.
```
### 8.3 CR 4.1 – Information confidentiality

#### 8.3.1 Requirement

```
Components shall
```
```
a) provide the capability to protect the confidentiality of information at rest for which explicit
read authorization is supported; and
```
```

```



##### IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019 – 53 –

```
b) support the protection of the confidentiality of information in transit as defined in
IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3 SR 4.1.
```
#### 8.3.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
The decision whether a given information should be protected or not depends on the context
and cannot be made at product design. However, the fact that an organization limits access to
information by configuring explicit read authorizations in the control system is an indicator that
this information should be protected by the organization. Thus, all information for which the
component supports the capability to assign explicit read authorizations should be considered
potentially sensitive and thus the component should also provide the capability to protect its
confidentiality.
```
```
Confidentiality of information in transit requires system level capabilities which the component
should be able to support.

```
For confidentiality protection, 8.5 provides further requirements.

- SL-C(DC, component) 4: CR 4.1

### 8.4 CR 4.2 – Information persistence

#### 8.4.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to erase all information, for which explicit read
authorization is supported, from components to be released from active service and/or
decommissioned.
```
#### 8.4.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Removal of a control system component from active service should not provide the
opportunity for unintentional release of information for which explicit read authorization is
supported. An example of such information can include authentication information and
network configuration information stored in non-volatile storage or other cryptographic
information that would facilitate unauthorized or malicious activity.
```
```
Information produced by the actions of a user or role (or the actions of a software process
acting on behalf of a user or role) should not be disclosed to a different user or role in an
uncontrolled fashion. Control of control system information or data persistence prevents
information stored on a shared resource from being unintentionally disclosed after that
resource has been released back to the control system.
```
#### 8.4.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Erase of shared memory resources
Components shall provide the capability to protect against unauthorized and unintended
information transfer via volatile shared memory resources.
```
```

```



##### – 54 – IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019

```
Volatile memory resources are those that generally do not retain information after being
released to memory management. However, there are attacks against random access
memory (RAM) which might extract key material or other confidential data before it is
actually over-written. Therefore, when volatile shared memory is released back to the
control system for use by a different user, all unique data and connections to unique data
need to be purged from the resource so it is not visible or accessible to the new user.
(2) Erase verification
Components shall provide the capability to verify that the erasure of information occurred.

### 8.5 CR 4.3 – Use of cryptography

#### 8.5.1 Requirement

```
If cryptography is required, the component shall use cryptographic security mechanisms
according to internationally recognized and proven security practices and recommendations.
```
#### 8.5.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
The selection of cryptographic protection should be based on a threat and risk analysis which
covers the value of the information being protected, the consequences of the confidentiality
and integrity of the information being breached, the time period during which the information
is confidential and control system operating constraints. This can involve either information at
rest, in transit, or both. Note that backups are an example of information at rest, and should
be considered as part of a data confidentiality and integrity assessment process. The control
system product supplier should document the practices and procedures relating to
cryptographic key establishment and management. The control system should utilize
established and tested encryption and hash algorithms, such as the advanced encryption
standard (AES) and the secure hash algorithm (SHA) series, and key sizes based on an
assigned standard. Key generation needs to be performed using an effective random number
generator. The security policies and procedures for key management need to address
periodic key changes, key destruction, key distribution and encryption key backup in
accordance with defined standards. Generally accepted practices and recommendations can
be found in documents such as NIST SP 800-57, Recommendation for Key Management –
Part 1: General [18]. Implementation requirements can be found for example in FIPS 140-2,
Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules [17] or ISO/IEC 19790 [9].

- SL 1 – Prevent the casual or coincidental circumvention of zone and conduit
    segmentation.
- SL 2 – Prevent the intended circumvention of zone and conduit segmentation by
    entities using simple means with low resources, generic skills and low motivation.

- SL 4 – Prevent the intended circumvention of zone and conduit segmentation by
    entities using sophisticated means with extended resources, IACS specific skills and
    high motivation.

### 9.2 Rationale

```
Using their risk assessment methodology defined in IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑2 [5], asset owners should
determine necessary information flow restrictions and thus, by extension, determine the
configuration of the conduits used to deliver this information. Derived recommendations and
guidelines should include mechanisms that range from disconnecting control system networks

Network segmentation is used by organizations for a variety of purposes, including cyber
security. The main reasons for segmenting networks are to reduce the exposure, or ingress,
of network traffic into a control system and reduce the spread, or egress, of network traffic
from a control system. This improves overall system response and reliability as well as
provides a measure of cyber security protection. It also allows different network segments
within the control system, including critical control systems and safety-related systems, to be
segmented from other systems for an additional level of protection.
```
```
Access from the control system to the World Wide Web should be clearly justified based on
control system operational requirements.
```
```
Network segmentation and the level of protection it provides will vary greatly depending on
the overall network architecture used by an asset owner in their facility and even system
integrators within their control systems. Logically segmenting networks based on their
functionality provides some measure of protection, but may still lead to single-points-of-failure
if a network device is compromised. Physically segmenting networks provides another level of
protection by removing that single-point-of-failure case, but will lead to a more complex and
more costly network design. These trade-offs will need to be evaluated during the network
design process (see IEC 6 2443‑ 2 ‑1 [1]).
```
```

```



##### – 56 – IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019

```
In response to an incident, it may be necessary to break the connections between different
network segments. In that event, the services necessary to support essential operations
should be maintained in such a way that the devices can continue to operate properly and/or
shutdown in an orderly manner. This may require that some servers may need to be
duplicated on the control system network to support normal network features, for example
dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP), domain name service (DNS) or local CAs. It may
also mean that some critical control systems and safety-related systems be designed from the
beginning to be completely isolated from other networks.
```
#### 9.3.3 Requirement enhancements

None
```
#### 9.3.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four SL levels that relate to CR 5.1 are:
```
- SL-C(RDF, component) 1: CR 5.1
- SL-C(RDF, component) 2: CR 5.1
- SL-C(RDF, component) 3: CR 5.1
- SL-C(RDF, component) 4: CR 5.1

### 9.4 CR 5.2 – Zone boundary protection

```
The zone boundary protection requirements are network-component-specific and can be
located as requirements for network devices in Clause 15.
```
### 9.5 CR 5.3 – General-purpose person-to-person communication restrictions

```
The general-purpose person-to -person communication restriction requirements are network-
component-specific and can be located as requirements for network devices in Clause 15.
```
### 9.6 CR 5.4 – Application partitioning

```
There is no component level requirement associated with IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3 SR 5.4.
```
## 10 FR 6 – Timely response to events..................................................................................

### 10.1 Purpose and SL-C(TRE) descriptions

```
Respond to security violations by notifying the proper authorities, reporting needed evidence
of the violation and taking timely corrective action when incidents are discovered.
```
- SL 1 – Monitor the operation of the components of the IACS, and respond to incidents
    when discovered, by collecting and providing the forensic evidence when queried.
- SL 2 – Monitor the operation of the components of the IACS, and respond to incidents
    when discovered, by actively collecting and periodically reporting forensic evidence.
- SL 3 – Monitor the operation of the components of the IACS, and respond to incidents
    when discovered, by actively collecting and pushing forensic evidence to the proper
    authorities.
- SL 4 – Monitor the operation of the components of the IACS, and respond to incidents
    when discovered, by actively collecting and pushing forensic evidence to the proper
    authorities in near real-time.

```

```



##### IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019 – 57 –

### 10.2 Rationale

```
Although a system may begin operation in a secure state, it is important to be able to monitor
the system to ensure that it remains in that secure state. If an event impacts the security of a
system, timely notification of the event may be critical to mitigating the associated risk. Asset
owners should establish security policies and procedures and proper lines of communication
and control needed to respond to security violations. Derived recommendations and
guidelines should include mechanisms that collect, report, preserve and automatically
correlate the forensic evidence to ensure timely corrective action. The use of monitoring tools
and techniques should not adversely affect the operational performance of the control system.
```
### 10.3 CR 6.1 – Audit log accessibility

#### 10.3.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability for authorized humans and/or tools to access audit
logs on a read-only basis.
```
#### 10.3.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
The applications and devices may generate audit records about events occurring in that
application or device (see 6.10). Access to these audit logs is necessary to support filtering
audit logs, identifying and removing information that is redundant, reviewing and reporting
activity during after-the-fact investigations of security incidents. In general, audit reduction
and report generation should be performed on a separate information system. Manual access
to the audit records (such as, screen views or printouts) is sufficient for meeting the base
requirement, but is insufficient for higher SLs. Programmatic access is commonly used to
provide the audit log information to analysis mechanisms such as security information and
event management (SIEM).
```
#### 10.3.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Programmatic access to audit logs
Components shall provide programmatic access to audit records by either using an
application programming interface (API) or sending the audit records to a centralized
system.
```
#### 10.3.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four SL levels that relate to CR 6.1 are:
```
- SL-C(TRE, component) 1: CR 6.1
- SL-C(TRE, component) 2: CR 6.1
- SL-C(TRE, component) 3: CR 6.1 (1)
- SL-C(TRE, component) 4: CR 6.1 (1)

### 10.4 CR 6.2 – Continuous monitoring

#### 10.4.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to be continuously monitored using commonly
accepted security industry practices and recommendations to detect, characterize and report
security breaches in a timely manner.
```
#### 10.4.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Control system monitoring capability can be achieved through a variety of tools and
techniques (for example, IDS, intrusion prevention system (IPS), protection from malicious
code mechanisms and network monitoring mechanisms). As attacks become more
```
```

```



##### – 58 – IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019

```
sophisticated, these monitoring tools and techniques will need to become more sophisticated
as well, including for example behaviour-based IDS/IPS.
```
```
Monitoring devices should be strategically deployed within the control system (for example, at
selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications) to collect
essential information. Monitoring mechanisms may also be deployed at ad hoc locations
within the control system to track specific transactions.
```
```
Monitoring should include appropriate reporting mechanisms to allow for a timely response to
events. To keep the reporting focused and the amount of reported information to a level that
can be processed by the recipients, mechanisms such as SIEM are commonly applied to
correlate individual events into aggregate reports that establish a larger context in which the
raw events occurred.
```
#### 10.4.3 Requirement enhancements

```
None
```
#### 10.4.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four SL levels that relate to CR 6.2 are:
```
- SL-C(TRE, component) 1: Not selected
- SL-C(TRE, component) 2: CR 6.2
- SL-C(TRE, component) 3: CR 6.2
- SL-C(TRE, component) 4: CR 6.2

## 11 FR 7 – Resource availability

### 11.1 Purpose and SL-C(RA) descriptions

```
Ensure the availability of components against the degradation or denial of essential services.
```
- SL 1 – Ensure that the component operates reliably under normal production
    conditions and prevents denial-of-service situations caused by the casual or
    coincidental actions of an entity.
- SL 2 – Ensure that the component operates reliably under normal and abnormal
    production conditions and prevents denial-of-service situations by entities using simple
    means with low resources, generic skills and low motivation.
- SL 3 – Ensure that the component operates reliably under normal, abnormal, and
    extreme production conditions and prevents denial-of-service situations by entities
    using sophisticated means with moderate resources, IACS specific skills and moderate
    motivation.
- SL 4 – Ensure that the component operates reliably under normal, abnormal, and
    extreme production conditions and prevents denial-of-service situations by entities
    using sophisticated means with extended resources, IACS specific skills and high
    motivation.

### 11.2 Rationale

```
The aim of this series of CRs is to ensure that the component is resilient against various types
of DoS events. This includes the partial or total unavailability of component functionality at
various levels. In particular, security incidents in the component should not affect essential
functions or other safety-related functions.
```
```

```

### 11.3 CR 7.1 – Denial of service protection

#### 11.3.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to maintain essential functions when operating in a
degraded mode as the result of a DoS event.
```
#### 11.3.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Components may be subjected to different forms of DoS situations. When these occur, the
component should be designed in such a manner that it maintains essential functions
necessary for continued safe operations while in a degraded mode.
```
#### 11.3.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Manage communication load from component
Components shall provide the capability to mitigate the effects of information and/or
message flooding types of DoS events.
```
#### 11.3.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four SL levels that relate to CR 7.1 are:
```
- SL-C(RA, component) 1: CR 7.1
- SL-C(RA, component) 2: CR 7.1 (1)
- SL-C(RA, component) 3: CR 7.1 (1)
- SL-C(RA, component) 4: CR 7.1 (1)

```
11.4 CR 7.2 – Resource management
```
#### 11.4.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to limit the use of resources by security functions to
protect against resource exhaustion.
```
#### 11.4.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Resource management (for example, network segmentation or priority schemes) prevents a
lower-priority software process from delaying or interfering with the control system servicing
any higher-priority software process. For example, initiating network scans, patching and/or
antivirus checks on an operating system can cause severe disruption to normal operations.
Traffic rate limiting schemes should be considered as a mitigation technique.
```

## – 8 – IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC

### 11.5 CR 7.3 – Control system backup

#### 11.5.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to participate in system level backup operations in
order to safeguard the component state (user- and system-level information). The backup
process shall not affect the normal component operations.
```
#### 11.5.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
The availability of up-to -date backups is essential for recovery from a control system failure
and/or misconfiguration. Automating this function ensures that all required files are captured,
reducing operator overhead.
```
```
When designing to support a backup capability, consideration should be given to information
that will be stored in backups. Some of this information may contain cryptographic keys and
other information that is protected through security controls while part of the system. Once the
information is placed into a backup it most likely will not have the same controls in place to
protect it. Thus, the component backup ability needs to include the mechanisms to support the
necessary protection of the information that is contained in the backup. This may include
encryption of the backup, encryption of the sensitive data as part of the backup procedure or
not including the sensitive information as part of the backup. If the backup is encrypted it is
important not to include the cryptographic keys as part of the backup but to backup the
cryptographic keys as part of a separate more secure backup procedure.
```
#### 11.5.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Backup integrity verification
Components shall provide the capability to validate the integrity of backed up information
prior to the initiation of a restore of that information.
```
#### 11.5.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four SL levels that relate to CR 7.3 are:
```
- SL-C(RA, component) 1: CR 7.3
- SL-C(RA, component) 2: CR 7.3 (1)
- SL-C(RA, component) 3: CR 7.3 (1)
- SL-C(RA, component) 4: CR 7.3 (1)

### 11.6 CR 7.4 – Control system recovery and reconstitution

#### 11.6.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to be recovered and reconstituted to a known secure
state after a disruption or failure.
```
#### 11.6.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Component recovery and reconstitution to a known secure state means that all system
parameters (either default or configurable) are set to secure values, security-critical patches
are reinstalled, security-related configuration settings are reestablished, system
documentation and operating procedures are available, components are reinstalled and
configured with established settings, information from the most recent, known secure backups
is loaded and the system is fully tested and functional.
```
#### 11.6.3 Requirement enhancements

```
None
```
```

- SL-C(RA, component) 4: CR 7.4

### 11.7 CR 7.5 – Emergency power

```
There is no component level requirement associated with IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3 SR 7.5.
```
### 11.8 CR 7.6 – Network and security configuration settings

#### 11.8.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to be configured according to recommended network
and security configurations as described in guidelines provided by the control system
supplier. The component shall provide an interface to the currently deployed network and
security configuration settings.
```
#### 11.8.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
These configuration settings are the adjustable parameters of the control system components.
By default, the component should be configured to the recommended settings. In order for a
component to detect and correct any deviations from the approved and/or recommended
configuration settings, the component needs to support monitoring and control of changes to
the configuration settings in accordance with security policies and procedures.
```
#### 11.8.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Machine-readable reporting of current security settings
Components shall provide the capability to generate a report listing the currently deployed
security settings in a machine-readable format.
```
#### 11.8.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four SL levels that relate to CR 7.6 are:
```
- SL-C(RA, component) 1: CR 7.6
- SL-C(RA, component) 2: CR 7.6
- SL-C(RA, component) 3: CR 7.6 (1)
- SL-C(RA, component) 4: CR 7.6 (1)

### 11.9 CR 7.7 – Least functionality

#### 11.9.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to specifically restrict the use of unnecessary
functions, ports, protocols and/or services.
```
#### 11.9.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Components are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the
functions and services provided may not be necessary to support IACS functionality.
Therefore, by default, functions beyond a baseline configuration should be disabled.
Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component

### 11.10 CR 7.8 – Control system component inventory

#### 11.10.1 Requirement

```
Components shall provide the capability to support a control system component inventory
according to IEC 6 2443-3-3 SR 7.8.
```
#### 11.10.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Components may bring their own set of components into the overall control system. When this
is the case then those components need to provide a mechanism to augment the overall
component inventory which is compatible with IEC 6 2443‑ 2 ‑4 [3] SP.06.02.

## 12 Software application requirements

### 12.1 Purpose

```
The purpose of this set of requirements is to document requirements that are specific to
software applications.
```
### 12.2 SAR 2.4 – Mobile code

#### 12.2.1 Requirement

```
In the event that a software application utilizes mobile code technologies, that application
shall provide the capability to enforce a security policy for the usage of mobile code
technologies. The security policy shall allow, at a minimum, the following actions for each
mobile code technology used on the software application:
```
```

```



##### IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019 – 63 –

```
a) Control execution of mobile code;
b) Control which users (human, software process, or device) are allowed to transfer mobile
code to/from the application;
c) Control the execution of mobile code based on the results of an integrity check prior to the
code being executed.
```
#### 12.2.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Mobile code technologies include, but are not limited to, Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, portable
document format (PDF), Postscript, Shockwave movies, Flash animations and VBScript.
Usage restrictions apply to both the selection and use of mobile code installed on servers and
mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations. Control procedures should
prevent the development, acquisition or introduction of unacceptable mobile code within the
control system in which the component resides. For example, mobile code exchanges may be
disallowed directly within the control system, but may be allowed in a controlled adjacent
environment maintained by IACS personnel.
```
#### 12.2.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Mobile code authenticity check
The application shall provide the capability to enforce a security policy that allows the
device to control execution of mobile code based on the results of an authenticity check
prior to the code being executed.

#### 12.3.1 Requirement

```
The application product supplier shall qualify and document which protection from malicious
code mechanisms are compatible with the application and note any special configuration
requirements.
```
#### 12.3.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Protection from malicious code (for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses and spyware)
may be provided by the control system application or by an external service or application.
Control system applications need to be compatible with mechanisms designed to protect them
from malicious code. This requirement does not imply that the product supplier is to qualify
and document all malicious code protection mechanisms which are compatible with the
application but implies that the product supplier is to qualify and document at least one
mechanism.

## 13 Embedded device requirements

### 13.1 Purpose

```
The purpose of this set of requirements is to document requirements that are specific to
embedded devices.
```
### 13.2 EDR 2.4 – Mobile code

#### 13.2.1 Requirement

```
In the event that an embedded device utilizes mobile code technologies, the embedded
device shall provide the capability to enforce a security policy for the usage of mobile code
technologies. The security policy shall allow, at a minimum, the following actions for each
mobile code technology used on the embedded device:
```
```
a) Control execution of mobile code;
b) Control which users (human, software process, or device) are allowed to upload mobile
code to the device;
c) Control the execution of mobile code based on the results of an integrity check prior to the
code being executed.
```
#### 13.2.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Mobile code technologies include, but are not limited to, Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, PDF,
Postscript, Shockwave movies, Flash animations and VBScript. Usage restrictions apply to
both the selection and use of mobile code installed on servers and mobile code downloaded
and executed on individual workstations. Control procedures should prevent the development,
acquisition or introduction of unacceptable mobile code within the control system in which the
component resides. For example, mobile code exchanges may be disallowed directly within
the control system, but may be allowed in a controlled adjacent environment maintained by
IACS personnel.

#### 13.2.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Mobile code authenticity check
The embedded device shall provide the capability to enforce a security policy that allows
the device to control execution of mobile code based on the results of an authenticity
check prior to the code being executed.
```
#### 13.2.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four SL levels that relate to EDR 2.4 are:
```
- SL-C(UC, component) 1: EDR 2.4
- SL-C(UC, component) 2: EDR 2.4 (1)
- SL-C(UC, component) 3: EDR 2.4 (1)
- SL-C(UC, component) 4: EDR 2.4 (1)

### 13.3 EDR 2.13 – Use of physical diagnostic and test interfaces

#### 13.3.1 Requirement

```
Embedded devices shall protect against unauthorized use of the physical factory diagnostic
and test interface(s) (e.g. JTAG d ebugging).

```



##### IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019 – 65 –

#### 13.3.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Factory diagnostic and test interface(s) are created at various locations within the embedded
device to assist the embedded device’s developers and factory personnel as they test the
functional implementation, and when errors are discovered to subsequently remove them from
the embedded device. However, these same interfaces should be carefully protected from
access by unauthorized entities to protect the essential functionality provided by the
embedded device to the IACS.
```
```
If a diagnostic and test interface does not provide an ability to control the embedded device or
to access non-public information, then it will not need an authentication mechanism. This shall
be determined via a threat and risk assessment. An example of this would be JTAG
debugging, in which JTAG is used to take control of the processor and execute arbitrary
commands, versus a JTAG boundary scan where JTAG is used to simply read information
(which may be publicly available information).
```
```
There may be cases where the factory diagnostic and test interface(s) use network
communications with the device. When this is the case those interfaces are to be subjected to
all of the requirements of this document.
```
#### 13.3.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Active monitoring
Embedded devices shall provide active monitoring of the device’s diagnostic and test
interface(s) and generate an audit log entry when attempts to access these interface(s)
are detected.
```
#### 13.3.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four SL levels that relate to EDR 2.13 are:
```
- SL-C(SI, component) 1: Not selected
- SL-C(SI, component) 2: EDR 2.13
- SL-C(SI, component) 3: EDR 2.13 (1)
- SL-C(SI, component) 4: EDR 2.13 (1)

### 13.4 EDR 3.2 – Protection from malicious code

#### 13.4.1 Requirement

```
The embedded device shall provide the capability to protect from installation and execution of
unauthorized software.
```
#### 13.4.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Unauthorized software may contain malicious code and thus be harmful to the component. If
an embedded device is able to utilize a compensating control, it need not directly support
protection from malicious code. It is assumed that the IACS will be responsible for providing
the required safeguards. However, for scenarios such as having a local universal serial bus
(USB) host access, the need for protection from malicious code should be determined by a
risk assessment.
```
```
Detection mechanisms should be able to detect integrity violations of application binaries and
data files. Techniques may include, but are not limited to, binary integrity and attributes
monitoring, hashing and signature techniques.
```
```
Prevention techniques may include, but are not limited to, removable media control, sandbox
techniques and specific computing platforms mechanisms such as restricted firmware update
capabilities, No Execute (NX) bit, data execution prevention (DEP), address space layout
```
```

```



##### – 66 – IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019

- SL-C(SI, component) 4: EDR 3.2

### 13.5 EDR 3.10 – Support for updates

#### 13.5.1 Requirement

```
The embedded device shall support the ability to be updated and upgraded.
```
#### 13.5.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Embedded devices over their installed lifetime may have the need for installation of updates
and upgrades. There will be cases where embedded devices are supporting or executing
essential functions as well. When this is the case the embedded device needs to have
mechanisms in place to support patching and updating without impacting the essential
functions of high availability systems (see 4.2). One example for providing this capability
would be to support redundancy within the embedded device.
```
#### 13.5.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Update authenticity and integrity
The embedded device shall validate the authenticity and integrity of any software update
or upgrade prior to installation.
```
#### 13.5.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four SL levels that relate to EDR 3.10 are:
```
- SL-C(SI, component) 1: EDR 3.10

- SL-C(SI, component) 4: EDR 3.10 (1)

### 13.6 EDR 3.11 – Physical tamper resistance and detection

#### 13.6.1 Requirement

```
The embedded device shall provide tamper resistance and detection mechanisms to protect
against unauthorized physical access into the device.
```
#### 13.6.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```

```
Tamper resistance mechanisms are most effectively used in combinations to prevent access
to any critical components. Tamper resistance consists of using specialized materials to make
tampering of a device or module difficult. This can include such features as hardened
enclosures, locks, encapsulation, or security screws. Putting in place tight airflow paths will
increase the difficulty of probing the product internals.
```
```
The purpose of tamper evidence is to ensure that visible or electronic evidence remains when
a tampering event occurs. Many simple evidence techniques are comprised of seals and
tapes to make it obvious that there has been physical tampering. More sophisticated
techniques include switches.
```
#### 13.6.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Notification of a tampering attempt
The embedded device shall be capable of automatically providing notification to a
configurable set of recipients upon discovery of an attempt to make an unauthorized
physical access. All notifications of tampering shall be logged as part of the overall audit
logging function.

The requirements for the four SL levels that relate to EDR 3.11 are:
```
- SL-C(SI, component) 1: Not selected
- SL-C(SI, component) 2: EDR 3.11
- SL-C(SI, component) 3: EDR 3.11 (1)
- SL-C(SI, component) 4: EDR 3.11 (1)

### 13.7 EDR 3.12 – Provisioning product supplier roots of trust.........................................

#### 13.7.1 Requirement

```
Embedded devices shall provide the capability to provision and protect the confidentiality,
integrity, and authenticity of product supplier keys and data to be used as one or more “roots
of trust” at the time of manufacture of the device.
```
#### 13.7.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
In order for a component to be able to validate the authenticity and integrity of the hardware,
software, and data provided by the product supplier, it should possess a trusted source of
data to perform the validation process. This trusted source of data is referred to as the “root
of trust” for the system. This trusted source of data may be a set of cryptographic hashes of
“known good” software, or it may be the public portion of an asymmetric cryptographic key
pair to be used in the validation of cryptographic signatures. This trusted data is often used to
validate critical software, firmware, and data prior to booting the firmware or operating system
of a component, in order to validate that the component will boot into a “known good” state in
which all security mechanisms are known to be operational and uncompromised. “Root of
trust” data is often protected via hardware mechanisms, preventing any modification of the
data during normal operations of the component. Modification of product supplier root of trust
data is typically limited to the product supplier’s provisioning process, where the product
supplier has a trusted process to perform the provisioning of the data. Instead, information to
be validated against the root of trust is submitted to the validation process through a hardware
or software API which performs the validation and returns the results without exposing the
protected data.

The requirements for the four SL levels that relate to EDR 3 .12 are:
```
- SL-C(SI, component) 1: Not selected
- SL-C(SI, component) 2: EDR 3 .12
- SL-C(SI, component) 3: EDR 3 .12
- SL-C(SI, component) 4: EDR 3.12

### 13.8 EDR 3.13 – Provisioning asset owner roots of trust

#### 13.8.1 Requirement

```
Embedded devices shall
```
```
a) provide the capability to provision and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity
of asset owner keys and data to be used as “roots of trust”; and
b) support the capability to provision without reliance on components that may be outside of
the device’s security zone.
```
#### 13.8.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Product suppliers have established mechanisms to ensure that the software and firmware on
their components is authentic, and the integrity of that software and firmware has not been
compromised. This allows the product supplier to provide the asset owner with a “known
good” state from which to operate. However, many product suppliers also provide
mechanisms for asset owners to extend the functionality of their devices through the use of
mobile code, user programs, or other such means. In order to protect the security of the
component, it is important that these extensions to the component’s functionality also be
validated to ensure that they are authorized, and that the asset owner has approved of their
origins.
```
```
In order to perform these validations, the component should contain data that provides a way
to differentiate between valid and invalid origins. The list of valid and invalid origins will differ
from asset owner to asset owner, and it is unlikely that a product supplier will have a complete
list of every possible valid origin at time of manufacture. Therefore, it is important that the
product supplier provide a way for the asset owner to securely provision their own “roots of
trust” which provide the ability to distinguish between origins allowed by the asset owner’s
security policy, and those that are not. The authenticity and integrity of these “roots of trust”
should be protected so that malicious actors cannot add additional roots of trust that grant
them the ability to operate on the component.
```
```
A root of trust can also be used as a basis communications security, such as communications
integrity required by CR 3.1 – Communication integrity ( 7.3) or communications confidentiality
required by CR 4.1 – Information confidentiality ( 8.3).
```
```
Requirements such as EDR 2.4 – Mobile code ( 13.2) require the component to complete
authenticity checks on mobile code prior to the execution of mobile code. The roots of trust
provided by this requirement provide the data necessary to validate the origin and integrity of
mobile code, allowing the component to independently determine if the code is allowed to
execute.

### 13.9 EDR 3.14 – Integrity of the boot process

#### 13.9.1 Requirement

```
Embedded devices shall verify the integrity of the firmware, software, and configuration data
needed for the component’s boot and runtime processes prior to use.
```
#### 13.9.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
In order to make assurances to an asset owner that a component’s security functionality has
not been compromised, it is necessary to ensure that the component’s software and firmware
has not been tampered with, and that the software and firmware is valid to execute on the
component. Therefore, the component should perform checks to validate the integrity of the
component’s firmware and/or software prior to use during the boot process, to ensure that the
component does not boot into an insecure or invalid operating state that could damage the
component or provide a path for a malicious actor to gain access to additional components,
assets, or data.
```
#### 13.9.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Authenticity of the boot process
Embedded devices shall use the component’s product supplier roots of trust to verify the
authenticity of the firmware, software, and configuration data needed for the component’s
boot process prior to it being used in the boot process.

## 14 Host device requirements

### 14.1 Purpose

```
The purpose of this set of requirements is to document requirements that are specific to host
devices.
```
### 14.2 HDR 2.4 – Mobile code

#### 14 .2.1 Requirement

```
In the event that a host device utilizes mobile code technologies, that host device shall
provide the capability to enforce a security policy for the usage of mobile code technologies.
The security policy shall allow, at a minimum, the following actions for each mobile code
technology used on the host device:
```
```
a) control execution of mobile code;
b) control which users (human, software process, or device) are allowed to upload mobile
code to the host device; and

```



##### – 70 – IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019

```
c) control the code execution based upon integrity checks on the mobile code and prior to
the code being executed.
```
#### 14.2.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Mobile code technologies include, but are not limited to, Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, PDF,
Postscript, Shockwave movies, Flash animations and VBScript. Usage restrictions apply to
both the selection and use of mobile code installed on servers and mobile code downloaded
and executed on individual workstations. Control procedures should prevent the development,
acquisition or introduction of unacceptable mobile code within the control system in which the
host device resides. For example, mobile code exchanges may be disallowed directly with the
control system, but may be allowed in a controlled adjacent environment maintained by IACS
personnel.
```
```
Mobile code could be secured by adding integrity, authenticity, and authorization checks to
the code itself (application layer), or for “just-in-time” code execution through transmitting the
mobile code via a secure communications tunnel which provides these attributes, or any
mechanism equivalent to these options.
```
#### 14.2.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Mobile code authenticity check
The host device shall provide the capability to enforce a security policy that allows the
device to control execution of mobile code based on the results of an authenticity check
prior to the code being executed.
```
#### 14.2.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four SL levels that relate to HDR 2.4 are:
```
- SL-C(UC, component) 1: HDR 2.4
- SL-C(UC, component) 2: HDR 2.4(1)
- SL-C(UC, component) 3: HDR 2.4 (1)
- SL-C(UC, component) 4: HDR 2.4 (1)

### 14.3 HDR 2.13 – Use of physical diagnostic and test interfaces

#### 14.3.1 Requirement

```
Host devices shall protect against unauthorized use of the physical factory diagnostic and test
interface(s) (e.g. JTAG debugging).
```
#### 14.3.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Factory diagnostic and test interface(s) are created at various locations within the host device
to assist the component’s developers and factory personnel as they test the functional
implementation, and when errors are discovered to subsequently remove them from the
component. However, these same interfaces should be carefully protected from access by
unauthorized entities to protect the essential functionality provided by the component to the
IACS.
```
```
There may be cases where the factory diagnostic and test interface(s) use network
communications with the device. When this is the case those interfaces are to be subjected to
all of the requirements of this document.
```
```
If a diagnostic and test interface does not provide an ability to control the host device or to
access non-public information, then it will not need an authentication mechanism. This shall
be determined via a threat and risk assessment. An example of this would be JTAG
debugging, in which JTAG is used to take control of the processor and execute arbitrary
```
```

```



##### IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019 – 71 –

```
commands, versus a JTAG boundary scan where JTAG is used to simply read information
(which may be publicly available information).
```
#### 14.3.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Active monitoring
Host devices shall provide active monitoring of the device’s diagnostic and test
interface(s) and generate an audit log entry when attempts to access these interface(s)
are detected.
```
#### 14.3.4 Security levels

```
The requirements for the four SL levels that relate to HDR 2.13 are:
```
- SL-C(SI, component) 1: Not selected

- SL-C(SI, component) 3: HDR 2.13 (1)
- SL-C(SI, component) 4: HDR 2.13 (1)

### 14.4 HDR 3.2 – Protection from malicious code

```
14.4.1 Requirement
```
```
There shall be mechanisms on host devices that are qualified by the IACS product supplier to
provide protection from malicious code. The IACS product supplier shall document any special
configuration requirements related to protection from malicious code.
```
#### 14.4.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Host devices need to support the use of malicious code protection (against, for example,
viruses, worms, Trojan horses and spyware). The product supplier should qualify and
document the configuration of protection from malicious code mechanisms so that the primary
mission of the control system is maintained.
```
#### 14.4.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Report version of code protection
The host device shall automatically report the software and file versions of protection from
malicious code in use (as part of overall logging function).
```
#### 14.4.4 Security levels

- SL-C(SI, component) 4: HDR 3.2 (1)

### 14.5 HDR 3.10 – Support for updates

#### 14.5.1 Requirement

```
Host devices shall support the ability to be updated and upgraded.
```
#### 14.5.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Host devices over their installed lifetime may have the need for installation of updates and
upgrades. There will be cases where host devices are supporting or executing essential

```

```



##### – 72 – IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019

```
functions as well. When this is the case the host device should have mechanisms in place to
support patching and updating without impacting the essential functions of high availability
systems (see 4.2). One example for providing this capability would be to support redundancy
within the host device.
```
#### 14.5.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Update authenticity and integrity
Host devices shall validate the authenticity and integrity of any software update or
upgrade prior to installation.
```
#### 14.5.4 Security levels

- SL-C(SI, component) 3: HDR 3.10 (1)
- SL-C(SI, component) 4: HDR 3.10 (1)

### 14.6 HDR 3.11 – Physical tamper resistance and detection

#### 14.6.1 Requirement

```
Host devices shall provide the capability to support tamper resistance and detection
mechanisms to protect against unauthorized physical access into the device.
```
#### 14.6.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
The purpose of tamper resistance mechanisms is to prevent an attempt by an attacker to
execute an unauthorized physical action against an IACS device. Secondary to prevention,
detection and response are essential should a tampering event occur.

to assist the component’s developers and factory personnel as they test the functional
implementation, and when errors are discovered to subsequently remove them from the
component. However, these same interfaces should be carefully protected from access by
unauthorized entities to protect the essential functionality provided by the component to the
IACS.
```
```
There may be cases where the factory diagnostic and test interface(s) use network
communications with the device. When this is the case those interfaces are to be subjected to
all of the requirements of this document.
```
```
Note that if a diagnostic and test interface does not provide the ability to control the product,
or to access non-public information, then it will not need an authentication mechanism. This
should be determined via a threat assessment. An example of this would be JTAG debugging,
in which JTAG is used to take control of the processor and execute arbitrary commands,
versus a JTAG boundary scan where JTAG is used to simply read information (which may be
publicly available information).
```
#### 15.5.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Active monitoring
Network devices shall provide active monitoring of the device’s diagnostic and test
interface(s) and generate an audit log entry when attempts to access these interface(s)
are detected.

```
If a network device is able to utilize a compensating control, it need not directly support
protection from malicious code. One such possible compensating control would be the use of
network packet filtering devices to identify and remove malicious code while in transit. It is
assumed that the IACS will be responsible for providing the required safeguards. However, for
scenarios such as having a local USB host access, the need for protection from malicious
code should be evaluated.

#### 15.7.1 Requirement

```
Network devices shall support the ability to be updated and upgraded.
```
#### 15.7.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Network devices over their installed lifetime may require installation of updates and upgrades.
There will be cases where network devices are supporting or executing essential functions as
well. When this is the case the network device should have mechanisms in place to support
patching and updating without impacting the essential functions of high availability systems
(see 4.2). One example for providing this capability would be to support redundancy within the
network device.

### 15.8 NDR 3.11 – Physical tamper resistance and detection

#### 15.8.1 Requirement

```
Network devices shall provide tamper resistance and detection mechanisms to protect against
unauthorized physical access into the device.
```
#### 15.8.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
The purpose of tamper resistance mechanisms is to prevent an attempt by an attacker to
execute an unauthorized physical action against an IACS device. Secondary to prevention,
detection and response are essential should a tampering event occur.
```
```
Tamper resistance mechanisms are most effectively used in combinations to prevent access
to any critical components. Tamper resistance consists of using specialized materials to make
tampering of a device or module difficult. This can include such features as hardened
enclosures, locks, encapsulation, or security screws. Putting in place tight airflow paths will
increase the difficulty of probing the product internals.
```
```
The purpose of tamper evidence is to ensure that visible or electronic evidence remains when
a tampering event occurs. Many simple evidence techniques are comprised of seals and
tapes to make it obvious that there has been physical tampering. More sophisticated
techniques include switches.
```
#### 15.8.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Notification of a tampering attempt
Network devices shall be capable of automatically providing notification to a configurable
set of recipients upon discovery of an attempt to make an unauthorized physical access.
All notifications of tampering shall be logged as part of the overall audit logging function.

integrity, and authenticity of product supplier keys and data to be used as one or more “roots
of trust” at the time of manufacture of the device.
```
```

```



### A.3 Device category: network device IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019 – 11 –

#### 15.9.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
In order for a component to be able to validate the authenticity and integrity of the hardware,
software, and data provided by the product supplier, it should possess a trusted source of
data to perform the validation process. This trusted source of data is referred to as the “root
of trust” for the system. This trusted source of data may be a set of cryptographic hashes of
“known good” software, or it may be the public portion of an asymmetric cryptographic key
pair to be used in the validation of cryptographic signatures. This trusted data is often used to
validate critical software, firmware, and data prior to booting the firmware or operating system
of a component, in order to validate that the component will boot into a “known good” state in
which all security mechanisms are known to be operational and uncompromised. “Root of
trust” data is often protected by software or hardware implemented mechanisms to prevent
any modification of the data during normal operations of the component. Modification of
product supplier root of trust data is typically limited to the product supplier’s provisioning
process, where the product supplier has a trusted process to perform the provisioning of the
data. Instead, information to be validated against the root of trust is submitted to the
validation process through a hardware or software API which performs the validation and
returns the results without exposing the protected data.

### 15.10 NDR 3.13 – Provisioning asset owner roots of trust...............................................

#### 15.10.1 Requirement

```
Network devices shall
```
```
a) provide the capability to provision and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity
of asset owner keys and data to be used as “roots of trust”; and
b) support the capability to provision without reliance on components that may be outside of
the device’s security zone.
```
#### 15.10.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Product suppliers have established mechanisms to ensure that the software and firmware on
their components is authentic, and the integrity of that software and firmware has not been
compromised. This allows the product supplier to provide the asset owner with a “known
good” state from which to operate. However, many product suppliers also provide
mechanisms for asset owners to extend the functionality of their devices through the use of
mobile code, user programs, or other such means. In order to protect the security of the
component, it is important that these extensions to the component’s functionality also be
validated to ensure that they are authorized, and that the asset owner has approved of their
origins.
```
```
In order to perform these validations, the component should contain data that provides a way
to differentiate between valid and invalid origins. The list of valid and invalid origins will differ
from asset owner to asset owner, and it is unlikely that a product supplier will have a complete
list of every possible valid origin at time of manufacture. Therefore, it is important that the
product supplier provide a way for the asset owner to securely provision their own “roots of

```



##### IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019 – 81 –

```
trust” which provide the ability to distinguish between origins allowed by the asset owner’s
security policy, and those that are not. The authenticity and integrity of these “roots of trust”
should be protected so that malicious actors cannot add additional roots of trust that grant
them the ability to operate on the component.
```
```
Requirements such as NDR 2.4 – Mobile code (15.4) require the component to complete
authenticity checks on mobile code prior to the execution of mobile code. The roots of trust
provided by this requirement provide the data necessary to validate the origin and integrity of
mobile code, allowing the component to independently determine if the code is allowed to
execute.
```
```
A root of trust is used to provide communications security, such as communications integrity
required by CR 3.1 – Communication integrity ( 7.3) or communications confidentiality required
by CR 4.1 – Information confidentiality ( 8.3).

### 15.11 NDR 3.14 – Integrity of the boot process

#### 15.11.1 Requirement

```
Network devices shall verify the integrity of the firmware, software, and configuration data
needed for the component’s boot process prior to it being used in the boot process.
```
#### 15.11.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
In order to make assurances to an asset owner that a component’s security functionality has
not been compromised, it is necessary to ensure that the component’s software and firmware
has not been tampered with, and that the software and firmware is valid to execute on the
component. Therefore, the component should perform checks to validate the integrity and
authenticity of the component’s firmware and/or software prior to the boot process, to ensure
that the component does not boot into an insecure or invalid operating state that could
damage the component or provide a path for a malicious actor to gain access to additional
components, assets, or data.
```
#### 15.11.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Authenticity of the boot process
Network devices shall use the component’s product supplier roots of trust to verity the
authenticity of the firmware, software, and configuration data needed for the component’s
boot process prior to it being used in the boot process.

### 15.12 NDR 5.2 – Zone boundary protection

#### 15.12.1 Requirement

```
A network device at a zone boundary shall provide the capability to monitor and control
communications at zone boundaries to enforce the compartmentalization defined in the risk-
based zones and conduits model.
```
#### 15.12.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
Any connections to outside of each security zone should occur through managed interfaces
consisting of appropriate boundary protection devices (for example, proxies, gateways,
routers, firewalls, unidirectional gateways, guards and encrypted tunnels) arranged in an
effective architecture (for example, firewalls protecting application gateways residing in a
DMZ). Control system boundary protections at any designated alternate processing sites
should provide the same levels of protection as that of the primary site.
```
#### 15.12.3 Requirement enhancements

```
(1) Deny all, permit by exception
The network component shall provide the capability to deny network traffic by default and
allow network traffic by exception (also termed deny all, permit by exception).
(2) Island mode
The network component shall provide the capability to protect against any communication
through the control system boundary (also termed island mode).
```
```
NOTE 1 Examples of when this capability can be used include where a security violation and/or breach has
been detected within the control system, or an attack is occurring at the enterprise level.
(3) Fail close
The network component shall provide the capability to protect against any communication
through the control system boundary when there is an operational failure of the boundary
protection mechanisms (also termed fail close).
```
```
NOTE 2 Examples of when this capability can be used include scenarios where a hardware failure or power
failure causes boundary protection devices to function in a degraded mode or fail entirely.

### 15.13 NDR 5.3 – General purpose, person-to -person communication restrictions

#### 15.13.1 Requirement

```
A network d evice at a zone boundary shall provide the capability to protect against general
purpose, person-to -person messages from being received from users or systems external to
the control system.
```
#### 15.13.2 Rationale and supplemental guidance............................................................

```
General purpose, person-to -person communications systems include but are not limited to:
email systems, forms of social media (Twitter, Facebook, picture galleries, etc.) or any
message systems that permit the transmission of any type of executable file. These systems
are usually utilized for private purposes that are not related to control system operations, and
therefore the risks imposed by these systems normally outweigh any perceived benefit.
```
```
These types of general purpose communications systems are commonly used as attack
vectors to introduce malware to the control system, pass information for which read
authorization exists to locations external to the control system and introduce excessive
network loading that can be used to create security problems or launch attacks on the control
system.
```
```
Network devices could realize such restrictions, for example, by blocking specific
communications based on port numbers and source and/or target address as well as more in
depth checks by application layer firewalls.

## Annex A (informative) Device categories

### A.1 General

```
The devices described in these categories are intended as representative samples for each
category, and not an exhaustive list.
```
### A.2 Device category: embedded device

#### A.2.1 Programmable logic controller (PLC)

```
The term "programmable logic controller" is expanded from IEC 6 0050-351:2013, 351-47-22
[11] and is commonly used in the process and discrete manufacturing industries. A PLC is a
device that typically resides on the lower levels of the automation system (such as level 1 and
2 of the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture in ANSI/ISA-95.00.01 [15]). PLCs
commonly use ruggedized hardware to allow for operation in industrial environments and are
commonly based on commercial real-time operating systems (RTOS). Increasingly smart
sensors and actuators are also receiving forms of process control capability. PLCs and smart
sensor/actuators are programmed to execute control logic based on inputs from the process
(obtained from instrumentation like traditional temperature sensors, pressure sensors,
vibration sensors). The control logic's output is used to control the industrial process (through
actuators such as valves, pumps). The programming is usually done using engineering
software commonly run on host devices (for example, laptops or PC workstations). A common
programming language for control logic is IEC 6 1131-3, [13]. In larger systems, PLCs often
also communicate the process conditions as obtained from sensors to higher-level servers
and/or operator workstations and receive instructions from higher-level control functions or
operator workstations, which are translated into or forwarded as commands to actuators. For
the communication to higher-level functions such as control servers or operator workstations,
modern PLCs use Ethernet and transmission control protocol (TCP)/ Internet protocol (IP )-
based protocols, while for the communication to the instrumentation, industry standard
fieldbuses are commonly used (some of which are also available on Ethernet carriers, but
usually do not use the TCP/IP stack). Special PLCs are used for executing safety functions
which ensure that the process under control remains within the bounds of safe operation at all
times. PLCs, especially executing safety functions, should meet hard real-time and high
integrity and availability requirements.
```
#### A.2.2 Intelligent electronic device (IED)

```
The term "intelligent electronic device" is expanded from IEC TR 61850-1:2013 [14]. An
intelligent electronic device (IED) is conceptually very similar to a PLC, but the term is more
commonly used in power systems (specifically substation automation). An IED receives
measurements from the power equipment (for example, transformers, switches and circuit
breakers) and executes control logic or protection functions. Similar to PLCs, IEDs are
commonly programmed and parameterized using engineering software commonly run on host
devices (for example laptops and PC workstations). A modern standard way of describing the
configuration of IEDs and their functions is defined in IEC TR 6 1850-1. The output of the logic
executed by IEDs is transmitted to actuators (switches, circuit breakers, etc.). As opposed to
PLCs, IEDs commonly also have a HMI which allows a human user standing in front of the
IED to use the IED's functionality (often a subset necessary to support essential functions).
Also, substations, and therefore the IEDs used therein, have to be able to operate in complete
isolation (such as without any communication to higher-level systems outside the substation
or even without any communication to other IEDs or station-level workstations or servers).
Modern IEDs usually use Ethernet and TCP/IP-based protocols to communicate to higher-
level components, while communication to other IEDs may be done using Ethernet-based
protocols (in some cases TCP/IP-based, often directly on Ethernet) or fieldbuses (some of
```
```

```



##### IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019 – 85 –

```
which are available also on Ethernet carriers, but do not use the TCP/IP stack). Similar to
PLCs, IEDs should meet hard real-time and high integrity and availability requirements.
```
### A.3 Device category: network device

#### A.3.1 Switch

```
The term "switch" is expanded from IEC 6 0050-732:2010, 732- 01 -22 [12]. A switch is a device
in computer networks that links multiple network segments or network nodes together. A
switch is typically located at layer 2 (data link layer) of the OSI model (see ISO/IEC 7498-1
[6]). Modern switches, especially those designed for use in larger networks, typically provide
interfaces for configuration management and network management. These interfaces may
support the configuration of the switch (for example web-based via HTTP/HTTPS, file-based
via FTP/SFTP, command-line-based via SSH or via simple network management protocol
(SNMP)) as well as log and event management (for example via syslog).
```
#### A.3.2 Virtual private network (VPN) terminator

```
The term "virtual private network" is expanded from IEC 6 0050-732:2010, 732-01-10 [12].
Virtual private networks are logical networks that allow for the extension of private networks
across distances that are bridged by public networks. The use of the public network to cover
the distance is transparent/invisible to the VPN users. VPNs are established by creating a
logical tunnel at the border of the two segments of the private network. The tunnel is
established by VPN terminators, which are devices located at the network border. The data
packets from one segment are encapsulated (commonly also encrypted) at the VPN
terminator at then sent through a public network to the peer VPN terminator. There, the
encapsulation is removed (usually involving decryption) and the original packet is recovered
and forwarded into the local network segment. VPNs are also often used to allow roaming
users secure access to resources on their home network. In this scenario, a client software on
the roaming device acts as a local VPN terminator, encapsulating (and usually encrypting) all
data packets and forwarding them to the VPN terminator on the home network border.
Establishment of the tunnel between VPN terminators should be authenticated, which, in the
scenario of roaming users, typically is a user-based authentication. Hence, VPN terminators
may be used to collect data about roaming users, which may allow tracing their location and
other privacy related data.
```
### A.4 Device category: host device/application

#### A.4.1 Operator workstation

```
Operator workstations are used in control systems to display process information to human
users or operators and to allow them to interact with the control system (for example initiate
operational actions on the process, such as opening a valve, closing a switch, modifying
process set points). Depending on the respective operational requirements, operator
workstations are often required to be continuously available (at least a minimum set of
workstations out of all installed ones) to allow for an uninterrupted view of the process
conditions and the opportunity to interact with the process immediately, if necessary. In order
to obtain the data to be displayed and to send the commands issued by the human user,
operator workstations typically communicate with control servers and connectivity servers in
the control systems, sometimes they also directly communicate with PLCs. This
communication is commonly using Ethernet and TCP/IP-based protocols. Operator
workstations typically do not have to meet hard-real time requirements, but have high integrity
and (at least as a set of operator workstations) high availability requirements. They are
typically built from COTS PC hardware and run COTS client operating systems.
```
```

```



##### – 86 – IEC 62443-4-2:2019  IEC 2019

#### A.4.2 Data historian

```
Data historians are used in control systems to collect and maintain long-term process history
data. This data is commonly collected from control servers or directly from PLCs using
protocols based on Ethernet and TCP/IP. The data may be used in a variety of analyses, for
example, for process optimization or performance reporting but may also be used in reporting
to regulatory entities such as emission reporting or documentation of the product's production
process integrity (for example, as required by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
regulations for pharmaceutical products). They are typically built from COTS PC/server
hardware and run COTS client/server operating systems. Data is commonly stored using
COTS database products. Communication to data access clients and data sources is
commonly using TCP/IP-based protocols. Depending on the criticality of the process history
from a business perspective, data historians have moderate availability and integrity
requirements and typically no hard real-time requirements.

## Annex B (informative) Mapping of CRs and REs to FR SLs 1-4

### B.1 Overview...............................................................................................................

```
Annex B is intended to provide overall guidance to the reader as to how SL levels 0 to 4 are
differentiated on an FR-by-FR basis via the defined CRs and their associated REs.
```
### B.2 SL mapping table

```
Table B. 1 indicates which component level requirements apply to which FRs for a given
component security level capability SL – SL-C(xx, component). For a given FR, the required
component level requirements to meet a given SL-C are denoted by a check mark.
```
```
As an example, a component that achieves SL-1 in FR 7 satisfies the base requirements of
CRs 7.1 through 7.7. Note that satisfying CR 7.8 is not necessary to meet SL-1 because it is
not selected until SL-2 and higher security levels. Meeting SL-1 in this way is also denoted
SL-C(RA, component) = 1, to indicate that the component has a capability security level of 1
in resource availability, or FR 7.
```
```
A component that meets SL-2 in FR 7, or SL-C(RA, component) = 2 satisfies all requirements
from SL-1, and additionally satisfy CR 7.1 RE(1), CR 7.3 RE(1), and the base requirement for
CR 7.8.
```
```
Similarly, a component that meets SL-3 in FR 7, or SL-C (RA, component) = 3 satisfies all
requirements from SL-2, and additionally satisfy CR 7.6 RE(1).
```
```
A component that meets SL-4 in FR7, or SL-C(RA, component) = 4 satisfies all requirements
from SL-3. There are no base requirements or requirement enhancements in FR 7 that are
unique to SL-4, and thus all components which meet SL-3 also inherently meet SL-4.
```
```
Refer to IEC 6 2443‑ 3 ‑3:2013, Annex A for how a full SL vector that includes all foundational
requirements would be denoted.
