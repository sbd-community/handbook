## Reports on Computer Systems Technology

## The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and

## Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical

## leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test

## methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance

## the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the

## development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for

## the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in

## federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,

## guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities

## with industry, government, and academic organizations.

## Abstract

## Few software development life cycle (SDLC) models explicitly address software security in

## detail, so secure software development practices usually need to be added to each SDLC model

## to ensure that the software being developed is well-secured. This document recommends the

## Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) – a core set of high-level secure software

## development practices that can be integrated into each SDLC implementation. Following such

## practices should help software producers reduce the number of vulnerabilities in released

## software, reduce the potential impact of the exploitation of undetected or unaddressed

## vulnerabilities, and address the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent future recurrences.

## Because the framework provides a common vocabulary for secure software development,

## software acquirers can also use it to foster communications with suppliers in acquisition

## processes and other management activities.

## Executive Summary

## This document describes a set of fundamental, sound practices for secure software development

## called the Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF). Organizations should integrate the

## SSDF throughout their existing software development practices, express their secure software

## development requirements to third-party suppliers using SSDF conventions, and acquire

## software that meets the practices described in the SSDF. Using the SSDF helps organizations to

## meet the following secure software development recommendations:

- Organizations should ensure that their people, processes, and technology are prepared to

## perform secure software development.

- Organizations should protect all components of their software from tampering and

## unauthorized access.

- Organizations should produce well-secured software with minimal security

## vulnerabilities in its releases.

- Organizations should identify residual vulnerabilities in their software releases and

## respond appropriately to address those vulnerabilities and prevent similar ones from

## occurring in the future.

## The SSDF does not prescribe how to implement each practice. The focus is on the outcomes of

## the practices rather than on the tools, techniques, and mechanisms to do so. This means that the

## SSDF can be used by organizations in any sector or community, regardless of size or

## cybersecurity sophistication. It can also be used for any type of software development, regardless

## of technology, platform, programming language, or operating environment.

## The SSDF defines only a high-level subset of what organizations may need to do, so

## organizations should consult the references and other resources for additional information on

## implementing the practices. Not all practices are applicable to all use cases; organizations should

## adopt a risk-based approach to determine what practices are relevant, appropriate, and effective

## to mitiga te the threats to their software development practices.

## Organizations can communicate how they are addressing the clauses from Section 4 of t he

## President’s Executive Order (EO) on “Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity (14028)” by

## referencing the SSDF practices and tasks described in Appendix A.

## 1 Introduction

## A software development life cycle (SDLC)^1 is a formal or informal methodology for designing,

## creating, and maintaining software (including code built into hardware). There are many models

## for SDLCs, including waterfall, spiral, agile, and – in particular – agile combined with software

## development and IT operations (DevOps) practices. Few SDLC models explicitly address

## software security in detail, so secure software development practices usually need to be added to

## and integrated into each SDLC model. Regardless of which SDLC model is used, secure

## software development practices should be integrated throughout it for three reasons: to reduce

## the number of vulnerabilities in released software, to reduce the potential impact of the

## exploitation of undetected or unaddressed vulnerabilities, and to address the root causes of

## vulnerabilities to prevent recurrences. Vulnerabilities include not just bugs caused by coding

## flaws, but also weaknesses caused by security configuration settings, incorrect trust assumptions,

## and outdated risk analysis. [IR7864]

## Most aspects of security can be addressed multiple times within an SDLC, but in general, the

## earlier in the SDLC that security is addressed, the less effort and cost is ultimately required to

## achieve the same level of security. This principle, known as shifting left , is critically important

## regardless of the SDLC model. Shifting left minimizes any technical debt that would require

## remediating early security flaws late in development or after the software is in production.

## Shifting left can also result in software with stronger security and resiliency.

## There are many existing documents on secure software development practices, including those

## listed in the References section. This document does not introduce new practices or define new

## terminology. Instead, it describes a set of high-level practices based on established standards,

## guidance, and secure software development practice documents. These practices, collectively

## called the Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF), are intended to help the target

## audiences achieve secure software development objectives. Many of the practices directly

## involve the software itself, while others indirectly involve it (e.g., securing the development

## environment).

## Future work may expand on this publication and potentially cover topics such as how the SSDF

## may apply to and vary for particular software development methodologies and associated

## practices like DevOps, how an organization can transition from their current software

## development practices to also incorporating the SSDF practices, and how the SSDF could be

## applied in the context of open-source software. Future work will likely take the form of use cases

## so that the insights will be more readily applicable to specific types of development

## environments, and it will likely include collaboration with the open-source community and other

## groups and organizations.

## This document identifies secure software development practices but does not prescribe how to

## implement them. The focus is on the outcomes of the practices to be implemented rather than on

(^1) Note that SDLC is also widely used for “system development life cycle.” All usage of “SDLC” in this document is
referencing software, not systems.

## the tools, techniques, and mechanisms used to do so. Advantages of specifying the practices at a

## high level include the following:

- Can be used by organizations in any sector or community, regardless of size or

## cybersecurity sophistication

- Can be applied to software developed to support information technology (IT), industrial

## control systems (ICS), cyber-physical systems (CPS), or the Internet of Things (IoT)

- Can be integrated into any existing software development workflow and automated

## toolchain; should not negatively affect organizations that already have robust secure

## software development practices in place

- Makes the practices broadly applicable, not specific to particular technologies, platforms,

## programming languages, SDLC models, development environments, operating

## environments, tools, etc.

- Can help an organization document its secure software development practices today and

## define its future target practices as part of its continuous improvement process

- Can assist an organization currently using a classic software development model in

## transitioning its secure software development practices for use with a modern software

## development model (e.g., agile, DevOps)

- Can assist organizations that are procuring and using software to understand secure

## software development practices employed by their suppliers

## This document provides a common language to describe fundamental secure software

## development practices. This is similar to the approach taken by the Framework for Improving

## Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity , also known as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework

## [NISTCSF].^2 Expertise in secure software development is not required to understand the

## practices. The common language helps facilitate communications about secure software practices

## among both internal and external organizational stakeholders, such as:

- Business owners, software developers, project managers and leads, cybersecurity

## professionals, and operations and platform engineers within an organization who need to

## clearly communicate with each other about secure software development

- Software acquirers, including federal agencies and other organizations, that want to

## define required or desired characteristics for software in their acquisition processes in

## order to have higher-quality software (particularly with fewer significant security

## vulnerabilities)^3

(^2) The SSDF practices may help support the NIST Cybersecurity Framework Functions, Categories, and Subcategories, but the
SSDF practices do not map to them and are typically the responsibility of different parties. Developers can adopt SSDF
practices, and the outcomes of their work could help organizations with their operational security in support of the
Cybersecurity Framework.
(^3) Future work may provide more practical guidance for software acquirers on how they can leverage the SSDF in specific use
cases.

- Software producers (e.g., commercial-off-the-shelf [COTS] product vendors,

## government-off-the-shelf [GOTS] software developers, software developers working

## within or on behalf of software acquirer organizations) that want to integrate secure

## software development practices throughout their SDLCs, express their secure software

## practices to their customers, or define requirements for their suppliers

## This document’s practices are not based on the assumption that all organizations have the same

## security objectives and priorities. Rather, the recommendations reflect that each software

## producer may have unique security assumptions, and each software acquirer may have unique

## security needs and requirements. While the aim is for each software producer to follow all

## applicable practices, the expectation is that the degree to which each practice is implemented and

## the formality of the implementation will vary based on the producer’s security assumptions. The

## practices provide flexibility for implementers, but they are also clear to avoid leaving too much

## open to interpretation.

## Although most of these practices are relevant to any software development effort, some are not.

## For example, if developing a particular piece of software does not involve using a compiler,

## there would be no need to follow a practice on configuring the compiler to improve executable

## security. Some practices are foundational, while others are more advanced and depend on certain

## foundational practices already being in place. Also, practices are not all equally important for all

## cases.

## Factors such as risk, cost, feasibility, and applicability should be considered when deciding

## which practices to use and how much time and resources to devote to each practice.^4

## Automatability is also an important factor to consider, especially for implementing practices at

## scale. The practices, tasks, and implementation examples represent a starting point to consider;

## they are meant to be changed and customized, and they are not prioritized. Any stated frequency

## for performing practices is notional. The intention of the SSDF is not to create a checklist to

## follow, but to provide a basis for planning and implementing a risk-based approach to adopting

## secure software development practices.

## The responsibility for implementing the practices may be distributed among different

## organizations based on the delivery of the software and services (e.g., infrastructure as a service,

## software as a service, platform as a service, container as a service, serverless). In these situations,

## it likely follows a shared responsibility model involving the platform/service providers and the

## tenant organization that is consuming those platforms/services. The tenant organization should

## establish an agreement with the providers that specifies which party is responsible for each

## practice and task and how each provider will attest to their conformance with the agreement.

## 2 The Secure Software Development Framework

## This document defines version 1.1 of the Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)

## with fundamental, sound, and secure recommended practices based on established secure

## software development practice documents. The practices are organized into four groups:

## 1. Prepare the Organization (PO): Organizations should ensure that their people,

## processes, and technology are prepared to perform secure software development at the

## organization level. Many organizations will find some PO practices to also be applicable

## to subsets of their software development, like individual development groups or projects.

## 2. Protect the Software (PS): Organizations should protect all components of their

## software from tampering and unauthorized access.

## 3. Produce Well-Secured Software (PW): Organizations should produce well-secured

## software with minimal security vulnerabilities in its releases.

## 4. Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV): Organizations should identify residual vulnerabilities

## in their software releases and respond appropriately to address those vulnerabilities and

## prevent similar ones from occurring in the future.

## Each practice definition includes the following elements:

- **Practice:** The name of the practice and a unique identifier, followed by a brief

## explanation of what the practice is and why it is beneficial

- **Tasks:** One or more actions that may be needed to perform a practice
- **Notional Implementation Examples:** One or more notional examples of types of tools,

## processes, or other methods that could be used to help implement a task. No examples or

## combination of examples are required, and the stated examples are not the only feasible

## options. Some examples may not be applicable to certain organizations and situations.

- **References:** Pointers to one or more established secure development practice documents

## and their mappings to a particular task. Not all references will apply to all instances of

## software development.

## Table 1 defines the practices. They are only a subset of what an organization may need to do.

## The information in the table is space constrained; much more information on each practice can

## be found in the references. Note that the order of the practices, tasks, and notional

## implementation examples in the table is not intended to imply the sequence of implementation or

## the relative importance of any practice, task, or example.

## The table uses terms like “sensitive data,” “qualified person,” and “well-secured,” which are not

## defined in this publication. Organizations adopting the SSDF should define these terms in the

## context of their own environments and use cases. The same is true for the names of

## environments, like “development,” “build,” “staging,” “integration,” “test,” “production,” and

## “distribution,” which vary widely among organizations and projects. Enumerating your

## environments is necessary in order to secure them properly, and especially to prevent lateral

## movement of attackers from environment to environment.

**Prepare the Organization (PO)**

**Define Security Requirements for Software
Development (PO.1)** : Ensure that security
requirements for software development are
known at all times so that they can be taken into
account throughout the SDLC and duplication of
effort can be minimized because the
requirements information can be collected once
and shared. This includes requirements from
internal sources (e.g., the organization’s policies,
business objectives, and risk management
strategy) and external sources (e.g., applicable
laws and regulations).

```
PO.1.1 : Identify and document all security
requirements for the organization’s software
development infrastructures and processes, and
maintain the requirements over time.
```
```
Example 1 : Define policies for securing software development infrastructures and
their components, including development endpoints, throughout the SDLC and
maintaining that security.
Example 2 : Define policies for securing software development processes
throughout the SDLC and maintaining that security, including for open-source and
other third-party software components utilized by software being developed.
Example 3 : Review and update security requirements at least annually, or sooner
if there are new requirements from internal or external sources, or a major
security incident targeting software development infrastructure has occurred.
Example 4 : Educate affected individuals on impending changes to requirements.

PO.1.2 : Identify and document all security
requirements for organization-developed software to
meet, and maintain the requirements over time.
```
```
Example 1 : Define policies that specify risk-based software architecture and
design requirements, such as making code modular to facilitate code reuse and
updates; isolating security components from other components during execution;
avoiding undocumented commands and settings; and providing features that will
aid software acquirers with the secure deployment, operation, and maintenance
of the software.
Example 2 : Define policies that specify the security requirements for the
organization’s software, and verify compliance at key points in the SDLC (e.g.,
classes of software flaws verified by gates, responses to vulnerabilities
discovered in released software).
Example 3 : Analyze the risk of applicable technology stacks (e.g., languages,
environments, deployment models), and recommend or require the use of stacks
that will reduce risk compared to others.
Example 4 : Define policies that specify what needs to be archived for each
software release (e.g., code, package files, third-party libraries, documentation,
data inventory) and how long it needs to be retained based on the SDLC model,
software end-of-life, and other factors.
Example 5 : Ensure that policies cover the entire software life cycle, including
notifying users of the impending end of software support and the date of software
end-of-life.
Example 6 : Review all security requirements at least annually, or sooner if there
are new requirements from internal or external sources, a major vulnerability is
discovered in released software, or a major security incident targeting
organization-developed software has occurred.
Example 7 : Establish and follow processes for handling requirement exception
requests, including periodic reviews of all approved exceptions.

Protect All Forms of Code from Unauthorized
Access and Tampering (PS.1) : Help prevent
unauthorized changes to code, both inadvertent
and intentional, which could circumvent or
negate the intended security characteristics of
the software. For code that is not intended to be
publicly accessible, this helps prevent theft of
the software and may make it more difficult or
time-consuming for attackers to find
vulnerabilities in the software.
```
```
PS.1.1 : Store all forms of code – including source
code, executable code, and configuration-as-code –
based on the principle of least privilege so that only
authorized personnel, tools, services, etc. have
access.
```
```
Example 1 : Store all source code and configuration-as-code in a code repository,
and restrict access to it based on the nature of the code. For example, open-
source code intended for public access may need its integrity and availability
protected; other code may also need its confidentiality protected.
Example 2 : Use version control features of the repository to track all changes
made to the code with accountability to the individual account.
Example 3 : Use commit signing for code repositories.
Example 4 : Have the code owner review and approve all changes made to the
code by others.
Example 5 : Use code signing^8 to help protect the integrity of executables.
Example 6 : Use cryptography (e.g., cryptographic hashes) to help protect file
integrity.

**Produce Well-Secured Software (PW)**

```
Design Software to Meet Security
Requirements and Mitigate Security Risks
(PW.1) : Identify and evaluate the security
requirements for the software; determine what
security risks the software is likely to face during
operation and how the software’s design and
architecture should mitigate those risks; and
justify any cases where risk-based analysis
indicates that security requirements should be
relaxed or waived. Addressing security
requirements and risks during software design
(secure by design) is key for improving software
security and also helps improve development
efficiency.
```
```
PW.1.1 : Use forms of risk modeling – such as threat
modeling, attack modeling, or attack surface mapping
```
- to help assess the security risk for the software.

```
Example 1 : Train the development team (security champions, in particular) or
collaborate with a risk modeling expert to create models and analyze how to use
a risk-based approach to communicate the risks and determine how to address
them, including implementing mitigations.
Example 2 : Perform more rigorous assessments for high-risk areas, such as
protecting sensitive data and safeguarding identification, authentication, and
access control, including credential management.
Example 3 : Review vulnerability reports and statistics for previous software to

management, identity management, access control,
and vulnerability management systems) instead of
creating proprietary implementations of security
features and services. [Formerly PW.4.3]
```
```
Example 1 : Maintain one or more software repositories of modules for supporting

software will meet the security requirements and
satisfactorily address the identified risk
information.

```
PW.2.1 : Have 1) a qualified person (or people) who
were not involved with the design and/or 2) automated
processes instantiated in the toolchain review the
software design to confirm and enforce that it meets all
of the security requirements and satisfactorily
addresses the identified risk information.
```
```
Example 1 : Review the software design to confirm that it addresses applicable
security requirements.
Example 2 : Review the risk models created during software design to determine
if they appear to adequately identify the risks.
Example 3 : Review the software design to confirm that it satisfactorily addresses
the risks identified by the risk models.
Example 4 : Have the software’s designer correct failures to meet the
requirements.
Example 5 : Change the design and/or the risk response strategy if the security
requirements cannot be met.
Example 6 : Record the findings of design reviews to serve as artifacts (e.g., in
the software specification, in the issue tracking system, in the threat model).

**Reuse Existing, Well-Secured Software When
Feasible Instead of Duplicating Functionality
(PW.4)** : Lower the costs of software
development, expedite software development,
and decrease the likelihood of introducing
additional security vulnerabilities into the
software by reusing software modules and
services that have already had their security
posture checked. This is particularly important
for software that implements security
functionality, such as cryptographic modules and
protocols.

```
PW.4.1 : Acquire and maintain well-secured software
components (e.g., software libraries, modules,
middleware, frameworks) from commercial, open-
source, and other third-party developers for use by the
organization’s software.
```
```
Example 1 : Review and evaluate third-party software components in the context
of their expected use. If a component is to be used in a substantially different way
in the future, perform the review and evaluation again with that new context in
mind.
Example 2 : Determine secure configurations for software components, and make
these available (e.g., as configuration-as-code) so developers can readily use the
configurations.
Example 3 : Obtain provenance information (e.g., SBOM, source composition
analysis, binary software composition analysis) for each software component, and
analyze that information to better assess the risk that the component may
introduce.
Example 4 : Establish one or more software repositories to host sanctioned and
vetted open-source components.
Example 5 : Maintain a list of organization-approved commercial software
components and component versions along with their provenance data.
Example 6 : Designate which components must be included in software to be
developed.
Example 7 : Implement processes to update deployed software components to
newer versions, and retain older versions of software components until all
transitions from those versions have been completed successfully.
Example 8 : If the integrity or provenance of acquired binaries cannot be
confirmed, build binaries from source code after verifying the source code’s
integrity and provenance.

Configure Software to Have Secure Settings
by Default (PW.9) : Help improve the security of
the software at the time of installation to reduce
the likelihood of the software being deployed
with weak security settings, putting it at greater
risk of compromise.
```
```
PW.9.1 : Define a secure baseline by determining how
to configure each setting that has an effect on security
or a security-related setting so that the default settings
are secure and do not weaken the security functions
provided by the platform, network infrastructure, or
services.
```
```
Example 1 : Conduct testing to ensure that the settings, including the default
settings, are working as expected and are not inadvertently causing any security
weaknesses, operational issues, or other problems.

RV.2.2 : Plan and implement risk responses for
vulnerabilities.
```
```
Example 1 : Make a risk-based decision as to whether each vulnerability will be
remediated or if the risk will be addressed through other means (e.g., risk
acceptance, risk transference), and prioritize any actions to be taken.
Example 2 : If a permanent mitigation for a vulnerability is not yet available,
determine how the vulnerability can be temporarily mitigated until the permanent
solution is available, and add that temporary remediation to the plan.
Example 3 : Develop and release security advisories that provide the necessary
information to software acquirers, including descriptions of what the vulnerabilities
are, how to find instances of the vulnerable software, and how to address them
(e.g., where to get patches and what the patches change in the software; what
configuration settings may need to be changed; how temporary workarounds
could be implemented).
Example 4 : Deliver remediations to acquirers via an automated and trusted
delivery mechanism. A single remediation could address multiple vulnerabilities.
Example 5 : Update records of design decisions, risk responses, and approved
exceptions as needed. See PW.1.2.

## The SSDF and Executive Order 14028

## The President’s Executive Order (EO) on “Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity (14028)”

## issued on May 12, 2021 [EO14028], charged multiple agencies – including NIST – with

## enhancing cybersecurity through a variety of initiatives related to the security and integrity of the

## software supply chain.

## Section 4 of the EO directed NIST to solicit input from the private sector, academia, government

## agencies, and others and to identify existing or develop new standards, tools, best practices, and

## other guidelines to enhance software supply chain security. Table 2 maps the subsections from

## Section 4e of the EO to SSDF practices and tasks that can help address each subsection as part of

## a risk-based approach.
