# Refuse to Accept Policy for 510(k)s

# Guidance for Industry and

# Food and Drug Administration Staff

**_This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA
or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements
of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the
FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page._**

## I. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to explain the procedures and criteria FDA intends to use in
assessing whether a premarket notification (510(k)) submission meets a minimum threshold
of acceptability and should be accepted for substantive review.

Focusing FDA’s review resources on complete submissions will provide a more efficient
approach to ensuring that safe and effective medical devices reach patients as quickly as
possible. Moreover, with the enactment of the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization
Act of 2002 (MDUFMA), the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2007 (MDUFA II),
the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2012 (MDUFA III), and the Medical Device
User Fee Amendments of 201 7 (MDUFA IV),^1 FDA agreed to performance goals based on
the timeliness of reviews. Acceptance review therefore takes on additional importance in
both encouraging quality submissions from submitters of 510(k) notifications and allowing
FDA to appropriately concentrate resources on complete submissions.

Therefore, the current 510(k) Refuse to Accept (RTA) policy includes an early review
against specific acceptance criteria and to inform the submitter within the first 15 calendar
days after receipt of the submission if the submission is administratively complete, or if not,
to identify the missing element(s). In order to enhance the consistency of our acceptance
decisions and to help submitters better understand the types of information FDA needs to
conduct a substantive review, this guidance, including the checklists included in the
appendices, clarify the necessary elements and contents of a complete 510(k) submission.
The process we outline is applicable to all devices reviewed through the 510(k) notification
process and has been compiled into checklists for use by FDA review staff.

It is critical to distinguish between the completeness of the regulatory submission, and the

(^1) See Title II of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-52).


quality of the data provided and any studies conducted in support of the submission. The
assessment of the completeness of the 510(k) occurs during the acceptance review, while the
assessment of the quality of the submitted information occurs during the substantive review.
FDA will base acceptance on the objective criteria outlined in the associated Acceptance
Checklist and not on the quality of the data.

The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to
bind the public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This document is
intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law.
FDA guidance documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only as
recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word _should_ in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended,
but not required.

## II. Background

The purpose of the 510(k) acceptance review is to assess whether a submission is
administratively complete, in that it includes all of the information necessary for FDA to
conduct a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence
under section 513(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act ( 21 United States
Code (U.S.C.) § 360c(i)). To find a device substantially equivalent under section 513(i) of
the FD&C Act, FDA must find that it has the same intended use as the predicate device, and
either (1) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or (2) has
different technological characteristics, as defined at section 513(i)(1)(B), and the submission
contains information, including appropriate clinical or scientific data if necessary, that
demonstrates the device is as safe and effective as the predicate and does not raise different
questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate.

The 510 (k) regulations at 21 CFR 807.87 to 807.100 provide greater detail regarding the
specific information that each premarket notification submission must contain. For example,
the submission must include proposed labeling (807. 87 (e)), a statement regarding the
similarities and differences between the device and others of comparable type (807.8 7 (f)),
supporting data (807.87(f) and 807.100(b)( 2 )(ii)(B)), and FDA may request any additional
information necessary to determine whether the device is substantially equivalent when the
information provided is insufficient to enable such a determination (807. 87 (m)). Please also
refer to our guidance document entitled, “Format for Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k)s.”^2

Prior guidances and checklists relating to 510(k) RTA policy (i.e., 510 (k) Refuse to Accept
Policy, dated June 30 , 1993 , and 510 (k) Refuse to Accept Procedures (K9 4 - 1 ) blue book
memo, dated May 20 , 1994 ) focused on defining broad issues or principles. Additionally, the
checklists associated with these guidances dealt largely with administrative elements but did
not address specific content that is essential for 510(k) review. As a result, FDA had accepted
many inadequate submissions for review, and FDA staff invested significant time in

(^2) https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/format-traditional-and-
abbreviated-510ks.


constructing extensive letters requesting all of the additional information needed to conduct a
substantive review. This approach was an inefficient use of resources and frequently
lengthened review times. For additional information see CDRH’s “Analysis Of Premarket
Review Times Under The 510(k) Program.”^3

The goal of the guidance titled “Refuse to Accept Policy for 510(k)s,” dated December 31,
2012 was to clarify the content needed in Traditional, Abbreviated, and Special 510(k)
submissions to allow FDA to conduct a substantive review, thereby enhancing the quality of
received 510(k) submissions and improving overall review time. The review process
presented in this document is captured in the Acceptance Checklists for Traditional,
Abbreviated, and Special 510(k) submissions, which FDA staff will use during the
acceptance review process.

## III. Scope

The information presented in this document is intended to provide FDA staff with a clear,
consistent approach for acceptance review for Traditional, Abbreviated, and Special 510(k)
notifications and to outline the RTA policy on 510(k)s. It will also help submitters prepare
510(k) notifications that are administratively complete for FDA to conduct a substantive
review.

The acceptance policy does not alter the substantial equivalence decision-making process
once the submission has been accepted for review; however, it does alter the start of the FDA
review clock for purposes of MDUFA performance goals for those submissions that are not
accepted for review. More information regarding FDA’s review clock is provided in Section
V of this document.

This document does not address the monetary aspects or the MDUFA goals associated with
510(k)s. Information pertaining to the fees and payment procedures for submission of a
510(k) notification can be found in FDA’s guidance document “User Fees and Refunds for
Premarket Notification Submissions (510(k)s).”^4

**IV. Q­submission Interaction**

For general information regarding the 510(k) regulations under 21 CFR Part 807, submitters
should consult CDRH’s Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) or CBER’s
Manufacturers Assistance and Technical Training Branch. Before submitting a 510(k)
notification, we encourage submitters, especially those who are less familiar with the 510(k)
review program or who have novel issues to address, to interact with the appropriate FDA
review staff. Such Q-submission interaction is an important way of improving the quality and
completeness of a 510(k). For additional information regarding the Q-Submission process,
please refer to the guidance titled “Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device

## V. 510(k) Refuse to Accept Policies and Procedures

```
FDA staff conduct acceptance reviews of Traditional, Abbreviated, or Special 510(k)s based
on objective criteria using the applicable Acceptance Checklist (see Appendices A-C) to
ensure that the 510(k) is administratively complete. In order for the submission to be
accepted, all administrative elements identified as RTA items should be present or a rationale
should be provided for those elements determined by the submitter to be not applicable. To
aid in the administrative review, it is recommended that submitters complete and submit
acceptance checklists with their submissions that identify the location of supporting
information for each RTA element.
```
```
The acceptance review occurs prior to the substantive review and should be conducted and
completed within 15 calendar days of FDA receiving the 510(k) notification. An acceptance
review will only begin for 510(k) submissions for which the applicable user fee has been

paid and a valid eCopy has been received.^15

The staff will select the applicable checklist based on the 510(k) type (i.e., Traditional,
Abbreviated, or Special). The acceptance review will be conducted on original 510(k)
submissions and responses to RTA communications, but not supplements or amendments
submitted in response to requests for additional information after a submission has been
accepted. The staff should assess whether the submission should be accepted by first
answering the preliminary questions below, and then verifying that the submission contains
all of the information identified as RTA items in the checklist.

The purpose of the 510(k) acceptance review is to assess whether a submission is
administratively complete, in that it includes all of the information necessary for FDA to
conduct a substantive review. Therefore, the submission generally should not be accepted
and should receive an RTA designation if one or more of the items noted as RTA items in the
checklist are not present and no explanation is provided for the omission(s). However, during
the RTA review, FDA staff has discretion to determine whether missing checklist items are
needed to ensure that the submission is administratively complete to allow the submission to
be accepted. FDA staff also has discretion to request missing checklist items interactively
from submitters during the RTA review. Interaction during the RTA review is dependent on
FDA staff’s determination that outstanding issues are appropriate for interactive review and
that adequate time is available for the submitter to provide supporting information and for
FDA staff to assess responses before the Acceptance deadline of 15 days.

If one or more items noted as RTA items on the Acceptance Checklist are not present and
FDA staff conducting the acceptance review determine that the submission should be
refused, FDA staff should obtain management concurrence and notify the designated 510(k)
contact person electronically^16 that the submission has not been accepted.^17 FDA staff should
also provide the submitter with a copy of the completed checklist indicating which item(s)
are the basis for the RTA designation.

The 510(k) submitter may respond to the RTA notification by providing the missing
information identified in the checklist. When providing the missing information, the
submitter should submit this information to be included in the file under the originally
assigned 510(k) number. A new submission and new user fee are not necessary. Nor is it

(^17) As outlined in the commitment letter for MDUFA III [158 CONG. REC. S8277-S8281 (daily ed. Corrected
December 20, 2012) (Letters from the Secretary of Health and Human Services Re: Medical Device User Fee
Program), also available at https://www.fda.gov/media/83244/download], the review clock will not start until
the 510 (k) submission is accepted for review.


necessary to re-send the entire 510(k) submission, unless FDA notes otherwise (e.g., because
the majority of the submission is not in English, or the submission is missing the majority of
the items on the checklist). It is sufficient to submit and address only the information
requested in the RTA notification. If a complete response to the RTA notification is not
received within 180 days of the date of RTA notification, FDA will consider the 510(k) to be
withdrawn and the submission will be closed in the system.

Upon receipt of newly submitted information in response to an RTA notification, FDA staff
should conduct the acceptance review again following the same procedure within 15 calendar
days of receipt of the new information. This acceptance review will assess whether the new
information makes the submission complete according to the checklist criteria for
completeness. If the submission is still found to be incomplete, FDA staff should notify the
contact person and provide a copy of the new checklist indicating the missing item(s).

When a submission is accepted, FDA staff should electronically notify the submission
contact person that the 510(k) has been accepted and begin a substantive review of the
submission to determine substantial equivalence. Should FDA fail or choose not to complete
the acceptance review within the acceptance review period (i.e., within 15 calendar days of
receipt), the submitter should be electronically notified that the acceptance review was not
completed and the submission is under substantive review. FDA may request any
information that may have resulted in an RTA designation during the substantive review.^18
Once a submission has been accepted, FDA may ask for any information during the
substantive review that may have been unintentionally overlooked during the acceptance
review.

_FDA Review Clock_

As explained in the commitment letter for MDUFA IV referenced in Title II of the FDA
Reauthorization Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-52), “FDA days begin on the date of receipt of
the submission or of the amendment to the submission that enables the submission to be
accepted (510(k)) or filed (PMA).”^19 As stated above, an acceptance review will only begin
for 510(k) submissions for which the applicable user fee has been paid and a valid eCopy has
been received. Thus, the FDA review clock does not start when a submission is placed on
eCopy or User Fee hold or designated RTA.

510(k) submissions and additional information submitted in response to a RTA designation
are received by the respective Center’s Document Control Center (DCC). The FDA review
clock start date is the DCC receipt date of the most recent submission or additional
information that resulted in an acceptance designation for the 510 (k), provided the submission
user fee has been paid and a validated eCopy has been provided. For example, if the

(^18) In the case of a government closure during the 15 - day acceptance review period, the review period may be
extended by a comparable number of business days that the FDA buildings are closed. If the submitter receives
an automated notice that the acceptance review was not completed because the screening period has exceeded
15 days, FDA may send a correction notice to the submitter.
(^19) See 163 CONG. REC. S4729-S4736 (daily ed. August 2, 2017) (Food and Drug Administration User Fee
Reauthorization), also available at https://www.fda.gov/media/102699/download.


submission is accepted for substantive review on the first acceptance review, the FDA review
clock start date is the DCC receipt date of the submission. However, if the submission is
designated RTA, the FDA review clock start date is not yet known. In such cases, the clock
start date will be the DCC receipt date of the submission including the additional information
that results in an acceptance designation (even if FDA later requests information that should
have been requested during acceptance review). In the event the acceptance review was not
completed within 15 calendar days, the submission will be considered to be under substantive
review, and the FDA review clock start date will be the DCC receipt date of the most
recently received information that was the subject of the acceptance review for the
submission. Once the submission is under substantive review the calendar days used to
conduct the acceptance review (i.e., up to 15 days) are included within the 60 calendar days
to reach the Substantive Interaction goal as described in the aforementioned commitment
letter for MDUFA IV.

_Notification of Acceptance Review Result_

The submitter should receive an electronic notification of the acceptance review result within
15 calendar days of DCC receipt (i.e., that the submission has been accepted for substantive
review, that the submission is not accepted for review (RTA), or that the submission is now
under substantive review because the acceptance review was not completed). The notification
will be sent only to the designated contact person identified in the submission. This
notification will also serve to identify the FDA 510(k) lead reviewer^20 assigned to the
submission. The notification of either the acceptance or RTA designation will be made only
with supervisory concurrence of the reviewer’s acceptance review determination. The
notification of acceptance or RTA designation may occur on any day prior to the 15th
calendar day of DCC receipt. However, in the event the acceptance review was not
completed within 15 calendar days, a notification that an RTA review was not completed will
be sent on the 16th day. In the case of RTA designation, the notification should be
accompanied by the completed checklist indicating the missing elements that resulted in the
RTA designation. The completed checklists are considered part of the submission’s
administrative file and are not posted publicly when FDA makes the RTA designation.
Therefore, it is imperative that the submission identify complete contact information,
including the email address to which the notification should be sent.^21

## VI. Refuse to Accept Principles

In order to use this guidance appropriately, FDA staff should review the following basic
principles regarding FDA’s review policies and procedures.

Acceptance should not be based on a substantive review of the information provided in the
510(k) notification.

(^20) In the case of 510(k)s submitted to CBER, whenever the term lead reviewer is used in this guidance, the
equivalent CBER contact person is the regulatory project manager (RPM).
(^21) CBER will accommodate the use of faxes; submitters may also wish to provide a fax number.


It is important to make the distinction between the acceptance review and the substantive
review. The acceptance review is conducted to assess whether the submission contains all of
the appropriate elements, as identified in the applicable checklist, in order to begin a
substantive review. In assessing whether a 510(k) notification should be accepted, submitted
information is not evaluated for adequacy to support a finding of substantial equivalence. The
checklist is a tool to ensure that the submission contains the necessary information in order to
conduct a substantive review (i.e., FDA should not refuse to accept a submission if
information is present but inadequate to support a finding of substantial equivalence). The
evaluation of the quality of the content and the substantial equivalence decision making
process occur within the substantive review once the file has been accepted.

FDA staff should determine whether the submitter provided a justification for any alternative
approach.

The submitter may provide a rationale for why any criteria in the checklist are not applicable
to the device. Likewise, the submitter may provide a rationale for any deviation from a
device- specific or cross-cutting guidance document or FDA-recognized standard. It is
FDA’s expectation that each item in the checklist will be addressed either by including the
requested information or providing a rationale for why it is not applicable or why there is a
deviation.

FDA will not consider a given criterion in the checklist to be “Present” if the submission fails
to include either the information identified or a rationale for omission or deviation. If a
justification to omit certain information or for taking an alternative approach is provided,
FDA will consider the adequacy of that justification or alternative approach during
substantive review of the submission. See Acceptance Review section below for examples
and further explanation.

Device-specific and cross-cutting guidance documents, applicable recognized standards, and
applicable regulations will be considered when making an RTA determination.

Before submitting a 510(k), the submitter should consider the currently available guidance
documents and standards, as well as applicable regulations for the proposed device in the
preparation of the submission. FDA staff and industry are encouraged to refer to the product
classification database^22 to assist in identifying any applicable recognized consensus
standards. If citing voluntary consensus standards, the submitter should consider FDA’s
guidance “Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for
Medical Devices.”^23

Specifically, the checklist includes questions regarding whether the submission has addressed
recommendations regarding the device description, labeling, and performance testing as
outlined in a device-specific guidance, special controls or another specific regulation. Note
that “addressed” means that the submission includes information pertinent to those

(^22) https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPCD/classification.cfm.
(^23) https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/appropriate-use-voluntary-
consensus-standards-premarket-submissions-medical-devices.


recommendations or requirements; assessment of the adequacy of that information in
meeting those recommendations or requirements should be assessed during review.

If there is a device-specific guidance, other than a special controls guidance document, the
submission includes information to establish that the submitter has addressed the
recommendations or otherwise provided an alternative approach intended to address the
applicable statutory and/or regulatory criteria.

If there are special controls applicable to the device, the submission includes information
addressing the particular mitigation measures set forth in the special controls, or uses
alternative mitigation measures and provides a rationale to demonstrate that those alternative
measures identified by the submitter will provide at least an equivalent assurance of safety
and effectiveness.

## VII. The Checklist – Preliminary Questions

Within 15 calendar days of receipt of the 510(k), FDA staff should answer the preliminary
questions below, which are included on the first page of the Acceptance Checklists for
Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k)s. The preliminary questions are intended to be answered
by the 510(k) lead reviewer as an initial screening of the submission. FDA does not intend
for the submitter to have addressed these items in their submission. Depending upon the
answers to these preliminary questions, the remainder of the acceptance review may or may
not be necessary.

If the responses to the preliminary questions and subsequent consultation with the Center
personnel identified below indicate that the 510 (k) acceptance review should not continue^24
the 510(k) lead reviewer should promptly:
· inform the 510(k) review team (including consulting reviewers); and
· notify the submitter using proper administrative procedures.

The preliminary questions are:

**1. Is the product a device (per section 201(h) of the FD&C Act) or a combination**
    **product (per 21 CFR 3.2(e)) with a device constituent part subject to review in a**
    **510(k)?**

```
If the product does not appear to meet the definition of a device under section 201(h) of
the FD&C Act, or does not appear to be a combination product with a device constituent
part, then the 510(k) lead reviewer should consult with the CDRH Product Jurisdiction
```
(^24) FDA will not process a 510(k) unless it meets the following requirements: i) the submission must be sent
with the user fee required by section 738 of the FD&C Act, and ii) a valid eCopy is provided. See section
738(a)(2)(A)(viii) and 738(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act, and the FDA guidance,
“eCopy Program for Medical Device Submissions,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-
information/search-fda-guidance-documents/ecopy-program-medical-device-submissions. Because any 510 (k)
not meeting these two requirements will not be processed by the respective Center’s DCC, they are not included
in the checklist.


```
Officer or the CBER Product Jurisdiction Officer to determine the appropriate action, and
inform management. If FDA staff determines that the product is not a device and is not a
combination product with a device constituent part, the 510(k) lead reviewer should stop
the review and notify the submitter.
```
**2**. **Is the submission with the appropriate Center?**

```
If the submission is for a single-entity device and appears to be subject to review in a
Center different from the one to which it was submitted, or if it is for a combination
product with a device constituent part and it appears that a Center different from the one
to which it was submitted has the lead, the 510(k) lead reviewer should consult with the
CDRH Product Jurisdiction Officer or the CBER Product Jurisdiction Officer to
determine the appropriate action and inform management. If the 510(k) is submitted to
CDRH and CDRH staff determines that the submission is not subject to CDRH review,
or the 510(k) is submitted to CBER and CBER staff determines that the submission is not
subject to CBER review, the 510(k) review team should stop the review and notify the
submitter.
```
```
3. If a Request for Designation (RFD) was submitted for the device or combination
product with a device constituent part and assigned to your center, identify the RFD
# and confirm the following:
(a) Is the device or combination product the same (e.g., design, formulation) as
that presented in the RFD submission?
(b) Are the indications for use for the device or combination product identified
in the 510(k) the same as those identified in the RFD submission?
```
```
An RFD determination is specific to the device or combination product and indications
for use for the device or combination product described in the RFD submission. If the
device or combination product has been modified or the indications for use have been
modified since the RFD, the RFD determination may no longer be applicable and
jurisdiction may need to be reevaluated by the Office of Combination Products (OCP).
The 510(k) lead reviewer should consult with the CDRH Product Jurisdiction Officer or
the CBER Product Jurisdiction Officer to determine the appropriate action and inform
management.
```
```
4. Is the submission for a combination product that contains as a constituent part a
drug that has the same active moiety as an approved drug with exclusivity as
described in section 503(g)(5)(C)(ii)-(v) of the FD&C Act?
```
```
If the submission is for a combination product and contains as a constituent a drug that
has the same active moiety as an approved drug with exclusivity as described in section
503(g)(5)(C)(ii)-(v) of the FD&C Act, the 510(k) lead reviewer should contact the CDRH
Product Jurisdictional Officer or CBER Product Jurisdiction Officer to determine the
appropriate action and inform management.
```
**5**. **Is this device type eligible for a 510(k) submission?**


```
FDA staff should determine whether the 510(k) submission is for a device type for which
510(k) is known to be an inappropriate regulatory approach, such as when the device type
is class III type and a PMA is required, or the device type is class I or II and 510(k)-
exempt. If a 510(k) is not appropriate, FDA staff should make this determination during
the acceptance review and notify the submitter of the determination. This preliminary
question is not intended to identify submissions for which a substantive review is
required in order to determine if 510(k) is an inappropriate approach (e.g., device has a
new intended use or device has different technological characteristics that raise different
questions of safety and effectiveness).
```
**6**. **Is there a pending PMA for the same device with the same indications for use?**

```
If the submitter has a PMA for the same device with the same indications for use
pending, the review team should stop the review. The 510(k) review team should consult
management and other Center resources to determine which premarket review pathway
applies to the device and the appropriate processes for addressing the situation. FDA staff
should also consult management and other Center resources if a 510(k) and PMA have
been submitted for the same device type by different submitters.
```
**7**. **If clinical studies have been submitted, is the submitter the subject of the
Application Integrity Policy (AIP)?**^25

```
The 510(k) lead reviewer should refer to the AIP list.^26 If the submitter is on the list, the
reviewer should consult the CDRH Office of Product Evaluation and Quality/Office of
Clinical Evidence and Analysis/Division of Clinical Science and Quality
(OPEQ/OCEA/DCEA1) or CBER Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality/Division
of Inspections and Surveillance/ Bioresearch Monitoring Branch (OCBQ/DIS/BMB) to
determine the appropriate action.
```
**VIII. The Checklists – Acceptance Review**

_Organizational Elements_

Although missing one or more of the items in the table of Organizational Elements in the
Acceptance Checklists, such as a Table of Contents or page numbers, generally will not lead
to an RTA decision, we strongly encourage submitters to incorporate these elements in their
submissions to facilitate FDA review and decision-making. If, however, the submission is so
disorganized that FDA cannot locate the information needed to assess substantial

(^25) When data in a pending submission have been called into question by certain wrongful acts (fraud, untrue
statements of material facts, bribery, or illegal gratuities), FDA intends to defer substantive scientific review of
such data until completion of a validity assessment and questions regarding reliability of the data are resolved.
( _See_ FDA Guide 7150. 09 Compliance Policy Guide, Chapter 50 – General Policy – Subject: Fraud, Untrue
Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities, 56 FR 46191 ).

policy/application-integrity-policy-list.


equivalence, or if the submission is so poorly written (e.g., in broken English) that the
information submitted to support substantial equivalence cannot be understood, the
submission should receive an RTA decision.

_Elements of a Complete Submission (RTA Items)_

The objective criteria in these checklists outline those elements that are explicitly required by
regulation or that are essential to FDA’s substantive review of the submission and
determination of substantial equivalence under section 513(i) of the FD&C Act. For example,
proposed labels, labeling, and instructions are required by 21 CFR 807.87(e)), while a
description of the materials, design, and other features of the device is essential to
determining whether its technological characteristics are the same as those of the predicate
and whether any differences raise different questions of safety and effectiveness under
section 513(i) of the FD&C Act.

We have also identified several categories and subcategories of data and information that,
when applicable, are critical to supporting a statement indicating the device is similar to
and/or different from other products of comparable type under 21 CFR 807.87(f) and the
substantial equivalence determination. For example, if the new device has direct or indirect
tissue-contacting components, a biocompatibility assessment will be essential to evaluating
whether the new device is as safe as the predicate with respect to the risk of toxicity it poses
to the patient. While testing and data would usually be necessary for such an assessment, this
is not always the case (for example if the device under review and the predicate are identical
in all relevant respects), and acceptance should be based only on the presence of an item or
an explanation why the item is not applicable, not the adequacy of such explanation. If the
device has no direct or indirect tissue-contacting components, no biocompatibility
assessment would be necessary and the biocompatibility items on the checklist would be not
applicable.

Because the applicability of these categories is also critical to the substantial equivalence
determination, in order to be accepted, all submissions should include a statement indicating
whether these categories apply, as outlined in the Acceptance Checklist (e.g., materials,
presence of software, whether the device is intended to be used sterile). When performance
data are provided, the submission of full test reports describing how the testing was
conducted is crucial to FDA’s assessment of whether the data support a finding of substantial
equivalence.

Where a device-specific guidance document exists for the subject device, the submitter
should follow the recommendations included in that document, or the submitter should
provide a rationale for addressing the scientific issues discussed in the guidance document
using an alternative approach intended to address the applicable statutory and/or regulatory
criteria. In the absence of the recommended information and without a rationale for an
alternative approach, the submission should be considered incomplete and not accepted. If
special controls have been identified, those controls should be addressed in order for the
submission to be accepted, or alternative mitigation measures providing a rationale to
demonstrate that those alternative measures will provide at least an equivalent assurance of


safety and effectiveness should be identified.

_Applying the Checklist of RTA Items_

Using the Acceptance Checklist appropriate to the submission type (traditional, abbreviated,
or special), within 15 calendar days of receipt of the 510(k), FDA staff should answer each
question for the elements identified as RTA items. For those items that have an option of
“yes,” “no,” or “not applicable (N/A)” as an answer, the item should receive an answer of
“yes” or “N/A” for the 510(k) submission to be accepted for substantive review.

For the first question in each section related to the need for certain performance data (such as
biocompatibility, sterilization, software), FDA staff should indicate whether the submission
has addressed one of the options for the 510(k) submission to be accepted for substantive
review. For example, the submission should state explicitly that either there are or are not
direct or indirect (e.g., through fluid infusion) tissue-contacting components in order for the
submission to be considered complete and accepted for substantive review.

_Elements Marked “Not applicable”_

In developing the checklists, the Agency has considered the general categories and respective
subcategories of information that are necessary to conduct a substantive review for the wide
range of medical devices that are appropriate for review under 510(k). All such criteria may
not be pertinent to a particular device. FDA staff should select “N/A” for those elements that
do not apply to the subject device. For example, the requirements for financial certification
and disclosure statements (21 CFR 807.87(i)) and statements of compliance for clinical
investigations (21 CFR 807.87(j)) only apply to submissions with clinical data. If the
submission contains no clinical data, FDA staff should select “N/A.”

_Adequacy of information_

In order to make the checklist criteria objective, for each RTA item, FDA should consider
only the presence or omission of the element or a rationale for the omission of the element or
use of an alternative approach during acceptance review. It is likely that FDA staff will
encounter scenarios where information is provided, but is incomplete or inadequate. In such
instances, FDA staff should answer the question for the respective item as “Yes,” but may
communicate the inadequacy or request additional information in the course of the
substantive review. For example, the submitter may have provided full test reports for all
performance testing; however, during the acceptance review, the reviewer may note that the
_results_ of a particular test may not be sufficient to support a finding of substantial
equivalence and additional justification would be needed. The performance testing criterion
would be marked “Yes” in the checklist, and the full assessment of the results and
communication to the submitter that additional justification is needed should occur during the
substantive review.

During RTA review, issues may be identified that do not determine the acceptability of a
submission, but are issues that should be resolved prior to a final decision. This does not


mean that a complete review of the submission has been conducted. These identified issues
are referred to as “observations.” If observations are identified, they will be attached to the
RTA checklist that is sent to the official contact. This attachment is called an Addendum.
You do not need to provide a response to the observation(s) in your RTA response in order
for your file to be considered administratively complete and accepted for substantive review;
however, addressing these questions could help to facilitate the substantive review of your
submission.

_Elements Marked “No”_

For any acceptance criterion designated as “No,” FDA intends to provide an explanation to
describe the missing element(s), if needed. This explanation is particularly important for a
criterion in which it may not be immediately apparent to the submitter what necessary
information, specifically, is not present. For example, the Device Description section
includes an element that states, “submission addresses device description recommendations
outlined in the device- specific guidance document” and a notation of “No” alone may not be
sufficient to inform the submitter of what specific piece(s) of information is missing. FDA
staff should include a list or statement of the additional information that is necessary to meet
the acceptance criteria. This list or statement can be communicated in the “comment” section
on the checklist beside each specific criterion.

_Prior Submissions Relevant to the Submission Under Review_

For certain submissions, the submitter may have made prior submissions for the same device
for which FDA provided feedback related to the data or information needed to support
substantial equivalence (e.g., a Q-Submission, investigational device exemption (IDE)
application, prior NSE determination, prior 510(k) that was deleted or withdrawn). When
such prior feedback is relevant to determining whether substantial equivalence of the subject
device exists, the new submission should include information to address this prior feedback
and the checklists should include criteria related to this issue. To address the criterion
regarding whether a prior submission (or no prior submission) exists, FDA recommends that
submitters provide this information in Section F (prior related submissions section) of the
CDRH Premarket Review Submission Cover Sheet form (Form 3514).^27 Submitters should
list prior submission numbers in Section F of this form or state that there were no prior
submissions to address this criterion. Please be advised that leaving this section of the form
blank will not be considered a statement that there were no prior submissions. This
information may also be included in the Cover Letter (i.e., as a statement that there were no
prior submissions for the device or a listing of the numbers(s) of the prior submission(s)).
Where one or more prior submissions do exist, FDA suggests designating a separate section
of the submission that identifies the prior submission(s) by number, includes a copy of the
FDA feedback (e.g., letter, meeting minutes), and states how or where in the submission this
prior feedback was addressed. Note that the adequacy of how the feedback was addressed
should be assessed during the substantive review.

_Combination Product Administrative Items_

The 21st Century Cures Act, which amended section 503(g) of the FD&C Act, requires
submitters seeking action on a combination product to identify the product as such (section
503(g)(8)(C)(v) of the FD&C Act). Additionally, per the amended section 503(g)(5),
submissions for device-led, device-drug combination products must include the patent
certification or statement as described in section 505(b)(2) and provide notice as described in
section 505(b)(3) if the combination product contains as a constituent part an approved drug
(see section 503(g)(5)(A) of the FD&C Act). Submitters of products that are not combination
products, as defined in 21 CFR 3.2(e), should mark “N/A” and omit this section pertaining to
combination products.

_Submitters of Combination Products That Do Not Contain as a Constituent Part an
Approved Drug_

If the combination products do not include as a constituent part an approved drug as defined
in section 503(g)(5)(B), submitters of device-led, device-drug combination products should
mark “N/A” for question 10 (question 9 in the Special RTA Checklist).

_Submitters of Combination Products That Contain as a Constituent Part an Approved Drug_

Submitters of combination products containing as a constituent part an approved drug should
address question 11 (question 10 in the Special RTA Checklist) by including patent
information. For each relevant patent, the submitter should include certification to one of the
following certifications:
i. That such patent information has not been filed (section 505(b)(2)(A)(i)).
ii. That such patent has expired (section 505(b)(2)(A)(ii)).
iii. The date on which the patent will expire (section 505(b)(2)(A)(iii)).
iv. That such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of
the drug constituent part for which this submission is made (section
505(b)(2)(A)(iv)).

However, for a method of use patent which does not claim a use for which the submitter is
seeking approval, the submitter should include a statement per section 505(b)(2)(B) that the
method of use patent does not claim such a use.

Submitters including a certification under paragraph (iv) (section 505(b)(2)(A)(iv)) should
also certify that they will provide notice to the owner of the patent(s) and the holder of the
approved application that lists the patent(s) that is/are being challenged. The process for
giving notice is provided in section 505(b)(3) of the FD&C Act. Submitters should submit to
FDA documentation of the date of receipt of notice by holder of the approved application and
patent(s) owner.

_Conversion of Special 510 (k) to Traditional 510 (k)_

FDA has developed separate checklists to address the differences in content for Special and


Traditional 510(k) submissions. FDA staff will utilize the appropriate checklist based on the
file type as designated by the submitter. In the event that the submitter has submitted a
Special 510(k), but FDA determines that the file should be converted to a Traditional
510(k)^28 FDA will notify the contact person designated in the 510(k) submission of the
conversion and the rationale for the conversion. If the file is converted from a Special to a
Traditional within the 15 calendar day acceptance review period, the Traditional 510(k)
Acceptance Checklist will be used to conduct the acceptance review and the review clock
start date will be assigned as outlined in the 510(k) Refuse to Accept Policies and Procedures
section above. Given the differences in content for Special and Traditional 510(k)s, it is
likely that the converted submission will result in an RTA designation using the Traditional
Acceptance Checklist. FDA staff should provide the completed Acceptance Checklist for
Traditional submissions indicating which elements are missing. The submitter may respond
by providing the identified information and the subsequent acceptance review will proceed
with the Traditional checklist. If the file is converted from a Special to a Traditional after the
15 calendar day acceptance review period, any missing information that would have resulted
in RTA designation should be obtained during the substantive review.
