# Engineering Trade‑Publication Content‑Marketing Article Style Guide
> **Purpose**  Help marketing teams and subject‑matter experts craft thought‑leadership pieces that meet the editorial standards of leading electronics‑engineering news sites (e.g., *EE Times*, *EDN*, *Electronic Design*, *Design News*, *Embedded.com*) while keeping brand promotion subtle and value‑driven.

---

## 1  Audience & Positioning

* **Primary readers:** practising hardware / firmware / systems engineers, engineering managers, and technical executives.
* **Knowledge level:** technically fluent—expect precise terminology over marketing jargon.
* **Takeaway:** deliver strategic insight, industry context, and actionable engineering guidance; *not* a product brochure.

## 2  Article Types Commonly Accepted

| Type                    | Typical Length  | When to Choose                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Opinion / Perspective* | ≈ 700 words     | Argue a position on standards, regulations, or market trends.                                              |
| *Executive Viewpoint*   | 800–1000 words  | Share C‑suite lessons learned and future outlook.                                                          |
| *Application Insight*   | 900–1200 words  | Explain how a technology solves a design or business problem—support with at least one real‑world example. |
| *Technology Overview*   | 1000–1500 words | Provide a survey of an emerging technology, comparing approaches and trade‑offs.                           |

> **Tip:** Reserve deep‑dive tutorials with schematics/code for sites that specialise in hands‑on content (e.g., *Embedded.com*).

## 3  Voice & Tone

* Write in **first‑person singular** as an engineer or executive—not as “the company.”
* **Confident yet balanced:** acknowledge limitations and trade‑offs.
* **Active voice**, present tense, plain American English (unless the publication states otherwise).
* **Vendor‑neutral language:** name your company only in the by‑line and author bio; avoid mid‑article product mentions unless absolutely necessary and clearly labelled.

## 4  Word Count & Readability

* **Sweet spot:** 650–900 words (most tech trade editors prefer concise pieces).
* **Paragraphs:** ≤ 80 words.
* Insert sub‑heads every 2–4 paragraphs to enable F‑pattern scanning.
* Aim for **Flesch Reading Ease 45–55** (≈ grade 12).

## 5  Recommended Article Structure

1. **Headline (H1):** ≤ 60 characters; keyword rich without click‑bait.
2. **Dek / Subtitle (optional):** one sentence expanding the hook.
3. **Lead (≤ 70 words):** establish context + promise the takeaway.
4. **Body:** organised under *H2* headings; use *H3* sub‑heads, bullet lists, or mini‑tables for clarity.
5. **Real‑world vignette:** one short paragraph illustrating impact.
6. **Key‑point recap:** concise bullet list.
7. **Forward‑looking close:** suggest next steps or raise an open question; invite reader comments.

## 6  Style & Formatting Rules

| Element                | Guideline                                                                                                                                              |

| Units                  | Adopt SI units; include imperial in brackets if critical.                                                                                              |
| Citations              | Hyperlink 3–5 authoritative external sources (standards bodies, peer‑reviewed work). No gated or promotional links.                                    |

| Headings               | Use sentence case unless house style dictates otherwise.                                                                                               |

## 7  SEO Meta (Most Sites Request)

* **Slug:** simple, descriptive URL string (editor often sets).
* **Meta description:** ≤ 155 characters summarising the benefit.
* **Keywords:** one primary + 1–2 secondary; weave naturally into headline, lead, and at least one sub‑head.
* **Alt‑text** and **title** attributes for every image.

## 8  Compliance & Ethics

* Content must be **original and exclusive** to the target publication (no prior web appearance).
* Disclose any conflicts of interest or client relationships.
* For regulated domains (medical, automotive safety, defence): avoid prescriptive claims; include a disclaimer: *“Information provided is for engineering discussion, not clinical or safety certification guidance.”*
* Acknowledge any AI assistance in drafting or image generation if required by the publication.
