Welcome to the **SecureByDesignHandbook.com** project!

<!-- truncate -->

Our mission is to build an authoritative, vendor-neutral reference for teams that make, integrate, or operate products with digital elementsâ€”from IoT sensors and industrial controllers to connected consumer devices. We're here to translate fast-moving regulatory obligations like the EU's **[Cyber-Resilience Act (CRA)](/docs/standards/eu/cra-overview)** and **[NIS 2 Directive](/docs/standards/eu/nis2-overview)** into concrete engineering practices that you can adopt without guesswork.

The regulatory landscape is shifting. For years, device security was a best practice; soon, it will be a legal requirement for market access in major economies. Manufacturers who cannot prove their products are secure-by-design risk fines, recalls, and reputational damage.

This handbook is designed to bridge the gap between legal text and firmware commit. We aim to help your teams move from asking "What does the law say?" to knowing "What do we build next sprint?"

### What You'll Find Here

*   **[Regulatory Explainers](/docs/standards)**: Succinct breakdowns of the CRA, NIS 2, RED, EN 303 645, IEC 62443, and more.
*   **[Implementation Playbooks](/docs/implementation)**: Step-by-step guides for enabling secure boot, generating SBOMs, and hardening your OTA update pipelines.
*   **[Templates & Checklists](/docs/resources)**: Ready-to-use artefacts like vulnerability disclosure policies and gap-analysis worksheets.

This is a community-driven project, and we welcome your contributions. Whether you're an embedded engineer, a compliance lead, or a security researcher, you can help us improve the content by opening an issue or submitting a pull request on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sbd-community/handbook).

Let's work together to make the next generation of connected devices Secure-by-Design.
